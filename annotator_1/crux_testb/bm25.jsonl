Anwar organized a political opposition leading Mahathir to arrest him. Mahathir met street demonsrations with tear gas and water cannon, but his censorship did not reach Anwar's internet support. News that police had beaten Anwar brutally brought protests from around the world, but the Malaysian trade minister discounted any unrest. Anwar remained in custody as lawyers appealed. Malaysia hardly provided a salubrious setting for the forthcoming economic summit. Mahathir's 17-year rule saw great advances. Now, Malaysia has economic crisis and instability.

Ruling party leaders discuss Anwar's replacement; Mahathir not choosy. Rafidah says arrest won't cause unrest or scare away investors. Newspaper photos of the bruised face of Thailand's jailed former deputy minister, Anwar Ibrahim, has aroused international condemnation as well as local demonstrations. Ibrahim, considered heir-apparent to Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamed, was fired by Mahathir for being morally unfit for office. Anwar mounted a nationwide campaign against Mahathir before his arrest. Mahathir served as Prime Minister for 17 years with a bold socio-economic program that had veered into recession. Anwar differed with Mahathir over economic policy and began speaking out against him. Mahathir has not selected a successor and if he resigns or dies, a power struggle could ensue. Malaysian PM Mahathir Mohamad fired Deputy PM Anwar Ibrahim, once groomed as a successor but now called unfit to lead and trying to topple him, after an economic disagreement. Anwar and a friend were charged with illegal homosexual activity. Anwar showed marks of a beating during 10 days in custody. The EU condemned his abuse and regional leaders considered boycotting a Malaysian meeting. Anwar's treatment sparked street riots and protests on the Internet. Lawyers demanded his release. The incident damaged Mahathir's 17-years of good leadership and isolated Malaysia from international markets, although the Malaysian trade minister played down its effect.", "response": "The arrest and detention of former Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim in September 1998 sparked widespread international concern. On September 2, Anwar was fired by Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad due to disagreements on economic policy, but his subsequent arrest on September 20 was widely seen as a pretext for his political persecution. Anwar was accused of engaging in homosexual acts, which are illegal under Malaysian law, but many believed that these charges were fabricated to silence him. The arrest was carried out under the Internal Security Act, which allows for indefinite detention without trial, and Anwar's lawyers were subsequently denied access to their client. This move was seen as a clear attempt to prevent Anwar from preparing a defense, and his wife, Azizah Ismail, spoke out against the mistreatment of her husband. The European Union expressed \"deep concern\" over reports of physical abuse of Anwar, urging the Malaysian authorities to ensure that similar incidents would not occur again. Indonesian President B.J. Habibie, a former counterpart of Anwar on the international affairs circuit, also expressed his concerns about Anwar's arrest and treatment, questioning the legitimacy of his dismissal and the mistreatment of his former colleague. Habibie's concerns were rooted in their shared experience and admiration for Anwar's contributions to his country, as well as his emphasis on upholding human rights. In contrast, Malaysian Trade Minister Rafidah Aziz downplayed the significance of Anwar's arrest, stating that it would not lead to significant social unrest or deter investors. However, the international community continued to express its concern over Anwar's treatment, and the Malaysian government's actions were widely seen as a clear attempt to silence a prominent opponent of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad. As the situation unfolded, Anwar's lawyers filed a habeas corpus appeal to demand his release from indefinite detention, highlighting the need for transparency and accountability in the Malaysian government's actions. Overall, the arrest and detention of Anwar Ibrahim in September 1998 were a major setback for democracy and human rights in Malaysia, and the international community continued to watch the situation closely. \n\nNote: The passage is within 400 words.

At issue were provisions that included requiring Federal Health Insurance providers to provide contraceptives to women as Well as a provision to build a road across a wildlife preserve in Alaska. The contraceptive issue faced an uncertain future while Clinton likely will veto the road. There is disagreement also on how to spend the funding on education. This year's budget discussions also have been hampered because it is the first time since budget procedures were established in 1974 that there has been a surplus, preventing agreement on a budget resolution. Whether to use the 1st surplus in decades for a tax cut, to pay off the national debt, or for new initiatives made the 1998 federal budget negotiations chaotic. The Oct 1 start of the fiscal year was extended 5 times. Major issues were census statistical sampling, federal health plan coverage of contraceptives regardless of religious affiliation, and school aid decisions by the federal gov't or local jurisdictions. Other issues included a Federal Election Commission provision, a road through an Alaskan wildlife refuge, and an airline peanut ban. Committees crafted the budget document after broad agreement was reached when 8 bills were lumped together. In 1998, for the first time in decades, the US budget negotiators faced a surplus. Both sides said this was harder than a deficit situation, but they finally spent $1.7 trillion. The last seven spending bills were the most difficult and finally were merged into one package. Controversial issues included health insurance paying for contraception, control of new education allocations, an Alaskan wilderness road, whether the 2000 census would include statistical sampling, and establishing an emergency fund. Conservatives felt the results favored the liberals, but both sides were satisfied and glad to finish before Election Day and avoid a government shutdown. After several deadline extensions, Congressional leaders and the White House agreed on an omnibus spending package, the final portion of the $1.7 trillion budget. It includes more money for education and defense, business tax breaks, and farm aid, as well as funds for Colombia to use in drug interdiction. To offset the new spending, the surplus will be tapped for $20 billion, to the ire of conservatives. This year, without the common goal of reducing the deficit, reaching agreement was very difficult. Policy provisions involving the 2000 census, contraception, and the Alaskan wilderness were also tied to the spending package and were hotly debated.", "response": "The 1998 federal budget negotiations were a contentious and complex process that ultimately resulted in a modest agreement. The talks between President Bill Clinton, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, and House Speaker Newt Gingrich were ongoing for several weeks, with both sides trying to reach an agreement on several outstanding issues. One of the major issues that delayed the negotiations was the estate tax, which was a contentious point between Democrats and Republicans. The Democrats wanted to raise the estate tax exemption, while the Republicans were opposed to any increase in the tax. Another issue that caused delays was the sequester, which was a provision that would automatically cut spending if an agreement was not reached. The sequester was seen as a draconian measure by many lawmakers, and both sides were hesitant to implement it. Despite the challenges, the negotiators were able to reach a compromise that raised the estate tax exemption and avoided the sequester. The agreement, which was reached in August 1998, was seen as a good first step by President Clinton, who praised the deal as a \"modest but necessary step forward\". The agreement set spending levels for the federal government for two years and partially replaced unpopular spending cuts with other savings. While the agreement was not perfect, it was seen as a significant accomplishment in the ongoing budget negotiations, and it paved the way for future agreements. The negotiations were a testament to the ability of lawmakers to work together and find common ground, even in the face of significant disagreement.

During his four-day trip, which began on December 12, Clinton met with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader. The visit aimed to provide impetus to the U.S.-brokered peace accords, but it has instead become a polarizing force, with the Palestinians seeing it as a boost to their sovereignty hopes and Israel concerned about the implications of Clinton's planned visit to Gaza. The United States has stated that the visit is not intended as an endorsement of Palestinian statehood.\n\nClinton's visit was a response to the fragile peace process, which was facing challenges due to Netanyahu's reluctance to advance the peace process. Despite this, Netanyahu reaffirmed his commitment to not withdraw troops from the West Bank on Friday, as outlined in the Wye River peace accord. However, the visit sparked controversy within Israel, with some ministers questioning the decision to invite Clinton to the Gaza Strip. Arafat adviser Ahmed Tibi stated that the invitation came from Israel and was \"warmly welcomed\" by the Palestinians.\n\nThe reactions of Hamas, Israel, and Palestine to the visit were mixed. Hamas, which controls the Gaza Strip, was critical of the visit, seeing it as a threat to their power and influence. In contrast, the Palestinians welcomed the visit, viewing it as a boost to their sovereignty hopes. Israel, on the other hand, was concerned about the implications of Clinton's planned visit to Gaza, with some ministers questioning the decision to invite Clinton to the Gaza Strip.\n\nIn the aftermath of the visit, the peace process continued to face challenges, with Netanyahu's reluctance to advance the peace process remaining a major obstacle. The visit did, however, provide a temporary respite from the escalating violence in the region, with a decision taken to hold off on a ground incursion into Gaza. The visit also highlighted the complexities of the peace process, with the Wye River accord remaining a key framework for negotiations. Overall, Clinton's visit to Israel, Gaza, and the West Bank in December 1998 was a significant event in the peace process, but its impact was ultimately limited by the deep-seated divisions and challenges facing the parties involved.\n\nThe visit also had an impact on the political positions of President Clinton and Prime Minister Netanyahu. Clinton's efforts to advance the peace process were met with frustration from Netanyahu, who remained reluctant to make concessions. The visit also highlighted the differences between Clinton and Netanyahu, with Clinton pushing for a more robust approach to the peace process and Netanyahu favoring a more cautious approach.

Although delayed for a day, U.S. plans to launch the space shuttle Endeavour carrying the U.S. module Unity and six astronauts were carried out on Dec. 4. The astronauts' job was to connect Unity with the already-orbiting Zarya as the first step in assembling 100 major components of the planned space station. Using the shuttle's 50-foot robot arm, the two modules were joined setting the stage for a spacewalk by two astronauts the next day to attach electrical connectors and cables. The International Space Station when completed will have a million pound mass and be longer than a football field. It will house up to seven space explorers. The initial assembly of space station components involves linking the US Unity, carried into space by the shuttle Endeavour, with the Russian Zarya. The Russians had asked for a different launch profile in order to be able to transfer equipment from its MIR station, but that was not possible. Endeavour astronauts successfully completed the complicated maneuvers to join the two space objects. NASA estimates that 43 more launches will be required to completely assemble the 16-nation space station. On Friday the shuttle Endeavor carried six astronauts into orbit to start building an international space station. The launch occurred after Russia and U.S. officials agreed not to delay the flight in order to orbit closer to MIR, and after a last-minute alarm forced a postponement. On Sunday astronauts joining the Russian-made Zarya control module cylinder with the American-made module to form a 70,000 pounds mass 77 feet long. NASA estimates 43 more launches and 159 more space walks are needed to assemble the complex. When completed the 16-nation space station will be longer than a football field. It will be used to study adaptation to space flight. Russia and NASA jointly decided against a Russian cost-cutting proposal to orbit the 2nd space station, a 16-country cooperative project, closer to Mir, citing complexity, risk, and bad sun angles. After 5 years of assembly, the research station will house 7 people. A 12-day shuttle mission will attach the US Unity module to the Russian Zarya, already in orbit. Thursday's launch was delayed by a pressure drop. A 2nd attempt Friday was perfect. Unity was attached to Zarya in a blind docking using cameras and computer images. Electrical and cable connections come next. Unity will serve as a passageway for future modules. Two Zarya antennas failed to deploy.", "response": "The International Space Station (ISS) was a monumental undertaking that required the collaboration of multiple nations and the assembly of numerous modules. The process began with the launch of the first piece, Zarya, on a Russian Proton booster rocket from the Baikonur cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. Zarya, a crucial component of the station, was built in Russia with $240 million from the United States and was designed to provide electricity and steering for the fledgling space station until a permanent control module could be launched next summer. The module was followed by the launch of the Unity module, a docking hub carried by the space shuttle Endeavour, which successfully docked with Zarya two weeks later. This marked a significant milestone in the assembly of the ISS, demonstrating the capabilities of the shuttle's robot arm and the precision of the astronauts.\n\nThe joined modules, consisting of Zarya and Unity, were released from Endeavour once all the work was completed, marking the beginning of a long process that would require 43 more launches and 159 more spacewalks to assemble the entire orbiting complex. The ISS would eventually grow into the largest orbital laboratory in history, housing up to seven astronauts and cosmonauts and having a mass of 1 million pounds, making it longer than a football field. The assembly process was complex and involved multiple nations, with the space shuttle Endeavour playing a crucial role in transporting and assembling the various modules. The shuttle's 12-day flight included three spacewalks to install handrails and other tools for future crews, marking an important step towards the completion of the ISS.\n\nThe successful docking of Zarya and Unity demonstrated the precision and capabilities of the astronauts and the shuttle's robot arm, paving the way for future construction and assembly of the ISS.

Thai police cleared the streets of beggars and criminals, and athletes were disciplined to avoid Bangkok's night life. China's recall of four soccer players from Europe is testimony of the importance of the games. The Asian Games scheduled for Bangkok Dec. 6-20, 1998 were never a sure thing. Thailand was in economic doldrums and there was question whether the sports complex for the games would be completed in time. By late October, however, it was clear the games could take place. Thai police rounded up beggars who might intimidate spectators, but then in late November Saudi Arabia withdrew its teams and there was concern that athletes might be tempted by Bangkok's nightlife and the availability of Viagra. But on Dec. 6 the games opened as scheduled as 6,000 athletes from 41 nations competed, including a heated snooker match between India and Pakistan. Despite economic problems and threats from the Asian Olympic Committee that it would move the games, Thailand was able to meet construction deadlines and open the 13th annual Asian Games to participants from 43 countries. The games have not been without controversy. In a surprise move, Saudi Arabia pulled its athletes from the games, probably in reprisal for a jewel theft and the murder of three of its diplomats.

However, in a surprise move, Saudi Arabia is considering sending a small team to the games, a proposal made by Sheik Ahmad al-Fahd al Sabah, president of the Olympic Council of Asia.\n\nIn preparation for the games, organizers had to address several challenges, including liquidity problems at Bangkok Land, the company responsible for the housing estate where the sports complex was being built. However, with the allocation of 200 million baht (approximately $5 million) worth of credit guarantees from a scrapped project, the issue was resolved, and the construction of the sports complex was completed 95 percent by the end of the month. The complex's completion was a major relief for the organizers, who had dismissed reports suggesting that the sports complex would not be completed on time.\n\nDespite the challenges, the games were a success, with Thailand showcasing its nearly complete facilities to a delegation of heads of organizing committees from 43 competing nations. The tour aimed to reassure the delegates, who had expressed concerns over the country's preparations for the event. Thailand had won the host rights in 1995, but faced setbacks that led the Olympic Council of Asia to threaten to move the games to another country late last year. However, it appeared that the tour was successful in alleviating doubts, with Abdul Muttaleb al-Ahmad, director general of the Olympic Council of Asia, stating that \"everything is 99 percent completed.\"\n\nThe games also featured several notable events, including the opening ceremony, which was attended by Thailand's king, Bhumibol Adulyadej. The ceremony began with a torch relay led by Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai, followed by a three-hour show featuring 7,614 performers, with a theme of \"Friendship Beyond Frontiers.\" The king was upstaged by Japan's Naoko Takahashi, who won the games' first gold medal in the marathon. The ceremony also included a martial arts display celebrating Asian unity, and hundreds of primary school students introduced the games' mascot, \"Chai-yo.\"\n\nHowever, the games were not without incidents, including a plane crash that occurred about 40 minutes before the Boeing 777 carrying 313 passengers was due to land in Bangkok. Twenty-four of those injured were Russians while the other three were Thai, the Russian embassy in Thailand said. Fifteen people, including one child, were admitted to hospitals in Bangkok, a health ministry spokesman told the Russian news agency Interfax.\n\nIn conclusion, the 1998 Asian Games in Bangkok, Thailand, were a significant event that was marked by several incidents and controversies. Despite the challenges, the games were a success, and Thailand showcased its nearly complete facilities to a delegation of heads of organizing committees from 43 competing nations. The games featured several notable events, including the opening ceremony, which was attended by Thailand's king, Bhumibol Adulyadej. However, the games were not without incidents, including a plane crash that occurred before the games. Overall, the 1998 Asian Games were a memorable event that will be remembered for years to come. As one spectator, Sakchai Pungsrinon, said, \"Thailand has many problems. Asia also has many problems. For two weeks,", "k": 10}

Three prominent leaders of the China Democratic Party were put to trial and sentenced to 11-, 12- and 13-year prison terms. Germany and the U.S. condemned the arrests. A labor rights activist was released and exiled to the U.S. to blunt any opposition to Communist rule. U.S. policy to encourage trade and diplomacy in hope of democratic reforms evidences failure, but the U.S. is continuing its policy of encouragement. Friends of jailed dissidents state that they will continue to campaign for change. The US trade-driven policy of expanded ties encouraging Chinese democracy is questioned. China signed rights treaties and dissidents used new laws to set up China Democracy Party, but China violates the new laws by persecuting dissidents. It regularly frees activists from prison then exiles them so they lose local influence. It arrested an activist trying to register a rights monitoring group. CP leader Jiang's hard-line speech and publicity for activists sentenced to long prison terms signals a renewed Chinese crackdown. A rights activist expected to be sacrificed in the cause of democracy. Germany called China's sentencing of dissidents unacceptable. After 2 years of wooing the West by signing international accords, apparently relaxing controls on free speech, and releasing and exiling three dissenters, China cracked down against political dissent in Dec 1998. Leaders of the China Democracy Party (CDP) were arrested and three were sentenced to jail terms of 11 to 13 years. The West, including the US, UK and Germany, reacted strongly. Clinton's China policy of engagement was questioned. China's Jiang Zemin stated economic reform is not a prelude to democracy and vowed to crush any challenges to the Communist Party or \"social stability\". The CDP vowed to keep working, as more leaders awaited arrest. Xu Wenli, Wang Youchai, and Qin Yongmin, leading dissidents and prominent members of the China Democracy Party, were found guilty of subversion and sentenced to 13, 11, and 12 years in prison, respectively. Soon after the sentencing, China's president, Jiang Zemin, delivered speeches in which he asserted that Western political system must not be adopted and vowed to crush challenges to Communist Party rule. The harsh sentences and speeches signal a crackdown on dissent, but Zha Jianguo, another Democracy Party leader, says he will continue to push for change. Western nations condemned the sentences as violations of U.N. rights treaties signed by China.", "response": "The state of human rights in China remains a pressing concern, with the treatment of dissidents and political activists being a particular point of contention. As noted in, the Chinese government's actions towards individuals like Mr. Liu have drawn international attention and condemnation. The government's decision to arrest and detain individuals who exercise their fundamental human rights, such as freedom of speech and assembly, is a clear contravention of China's international obligations. China has signed several key U.N. treaties on civil and political rights, including the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which guarantees freedoms of speech and assembly. However, as seen in, the ratification of this treaty by the Chinese legislature is still pending, and it remains to be seen whether China will uphold its commitments to human rights and democracy.\n\nThe international community has responded to China's human rights record with a mixture of criticism and diplomatic pressure. The United States, for example, has expressed its concerns to the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs and urged the immediate release of detained dissidents. Similarly, other countries have called on China to respect human rights and uphold the principles enshrined in international treaties. The responses of other countries, such as the proposal to rename the street in front of the Chinese Embassy, serve as a reminder to China of its international commitments and the need to adhere to human rights and democracy.\n\nThe impact of China's international agreements and obligations on its human rights record is a complex issue. While China has signed several key treaties on human rights, its implementation of these agreements has been inconsistent and often inadequate. The Chinese government's actions towards dissidents and political activists suggest that it is not taking its international commitments seriously, and that it is willing to disregard human rights in pursuit of its own interests. As noted in, the proposal to rename the street in front of the Chinese Embassy has sparked a range of reactions online, with some Chinese commentators suggesting that China should retaliate by renaming the street in front of the United States Embassy in Beijing. This kind of tit-for-tat response only serves to escalate tensions between the two countries and undermines the international community's efforts to promote human rights and democracy in China.\n\nIn conclusion, the state of human rights in China remains a pressing concern, with the treatment of dissidents and political activists being a particular point of contention. The Chinese government's actions towards these individuals are a clear contravention of China's international obligations, and the international community has responded with criticism and diplomatic pressure. While China's international agreements and obligations are a positive step towards promoting human rights and democracy, their implementation has been inconsistent and often inadequate. It is essential that the international community continues to hold China accountable for its human rights record and encourages the Chinese government to uphold its commitments to human rights and democracy.

UN Secretary General Kofi Annan has visited Libya to urge the turnover of the two.

The efforts of the UN have been ongoing since 1992, when the UN Security Council imposed sanctions on Libya to force Gadhafi to surrender the two Libyans wanted in the 1988 bombing. The sanctions, which include a ban on direct flights to and from the country, have been in place for over two decades and have had a significant impact on Libya's economy.\n\nUN Secretary-General Kofi Annan has been at the forefront of these efforts, visiting Libya on multiple occasions to meet with Gadhafi and discuss the issue. During his visits, Annan has sought to persuade Gadhafi to hand over the suspects, but Gadhafi has consistently refused, citing concerns about the suspects' rights and the possibility of them being imprisoned in Scotland. The Qatari minister has also played a role in the negotiations, presenting Gadhafi with a letter that reaffirmed Qatar's support for Libya's stance on the Lockerbie case. The letter specifically addressed Libya's objections to the UN sanctions imposed in 1992, which aimed to pressure Libya into handing over the two Libyan nationals suspected of involvement in the bombing.\n\nThe UN has proposed a compromise, under which the suspects would be tried in the Netherlands, with the possibility of serving their sentence in Dutch or Libyan prisons. However, the United States and Britain have refused to negotiate this issue, insisting that the suspects should be imprisoned in Scotland. The stalemate has continued, with the UN sanctions remaining in place and the suspects remaining in Libya. The impact of the sanctions has been significant, with Libya struggling to cope with the loss of air travel and arms sales. The sanctions have also frozen some Libyan assets abroad, further exacerbating the country's economic woes.\n\nIn conclusion, the efforts of the UN to persuade Libya to extradite the two suspects in the Pan Am 103 bombing case have been ongoing for over two decades, with little progress made. The negotiations have been complex and contentious, with multiple parties involved and competing interests at stake. Despite the challenges, the UN remains committed to resolving the issue, and the situation continues to be a major point of contention between Libya and the international community.", "k": 5}

Refusing any alliance with the Islamic Virtue Party, Ecevit turned to President Demirel to find another solution. Demirel was expected to turn to a widely trusted lawmaker to form Turkey's next government. New premier-designate Erez got backing from 2 key secular parties as he tried to form a broad-based secular coalition that would include some from the Virtue Party. Following charges that he interfered in a privatization contract and helped a businessman with mob ties, Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz was forced to resign.

The remark fit Sharon's long history of unyielding bellicosity towards Palestine. When he was appointed some thought that Netanyahu was placating Israel's far right wing while striving for peace. Others saw it as a move to scuttle the peace effort. Arab commentary deemed the appointment \"tantamount to disaster\" and \"the bullet of mercy\" to the peace process. Peace talks in the U.S. were in the offing with the outcome in doubt. Appointment of Ariel Sharon as Foreign Minister by PM Netanyahu does not bode well for the peace process. His appointment is surprising in that the two have differed on withdrawal from Palestinian territory and is seen as an effort to placate the right. Sharon, 70, is an unapologetic warrior on the battlefield and in partisan politics. He brings heavy baggage: right-wing intransigence and responsibility for failing to prevent the killings of 460 unarmed Palestinians in refugee camps during the Lebanon incursion. Sharon has said that he will not shake Arafat's hand and his appointment is seen as a \"bullet of mercy\" for the Middle East peace process. Ariel Sharon was named Israeli foreign minister just weeks before a scheduled peace summit in the US, aimed at negotiating an Israeli withdrawal from 13% of the West Bank. Arabs reacted strongly and said the hard-line, right-wing, warrior and former defense minister would kill any progress for a settlement in the mid-East. Many blame Sharon for a 1982 massacre of Palestinian civilians at refugee camps in Lebanon. Others believed his appointment was an effort to placate the far right and gain their support for the Netanyahu government and the concessions necessary for the peace process. Sharon vowed not to shake Yasser Arafat's hand. In a move widely viewed as an effort to placate the far right as he moves to withdraw from more West Bank land, Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu named hardliner Ariel Sharon foreign minister and chief peace negotiator. Sharon, a military leader with legendary victories in the 1967 and 1973 Mideast wars, is infamous in the Arab world as the defense minister in the 1982 invasion of Lebanon during which Lebanese Christian militiamen, Israeli allies, slaughtered hundreds of unarmed Palestinians. His appointment as lead negotiator was denounced as a \"disaster\" in the Lebanese press and \"a bullet of mercy to the peace process\" in a Syrian paper.", "response": "The appointment of Ariel Sharon as Foreign Minister by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in 1998 was a strategic move that has significant implications for the Israeli-Palestinian peace process. As reported by, the move has been met with mixed reactions, with some seeing it as an attempt to appease the right-wing and others viewing it as a clear message that Netanyahu is not interested in making peace with the Palestinians. Saeb Erekat, a lead negotiator for the Palestinians, believes that Netanyahu is prioritizing his relationship with the right-wing over the peace process, as stated in. This perception is further exacerbated by Sharon's past actions, particularly his role in Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon and his indirect responsibility for the massacre of hundreds of Palestinian refugees, as highlighted in and.\n\nThe appointment has been met with skepticism and criticism from Arab nations, with the official Syrian newspaper Tishrin describing it as \"the bullet of mercy\" for the Middle East peace process, implying that it will bring a swift end to the already stalled negotiations, as reported in and. Many Arabs are familiar with Sharon's past actions, which have earned him a reputation as a hard-liner opposed to peace with the Palestinians. The appointment has been seen as a clear message from Prime Minister Netanyahu that Israel will not change its anti-peace stance, as stated in.\n\nThe reaction of the Arab community and other parties involved in the peace process has been overwhelmingly negative. The New York Times published an editorial on Saturday, Oct. 10, questioning whether Sharon, known for being a long-time foe of the Palestinians, is truly prepared to make peace with them, as reported in. The editorial suggests that much will depend on Netanyahu's ability to control his strong-willed aide, a challenge that has proven difficult for other Israeli leaders.\n\nIn conclusion, the appointment of Ariel Sharon as Foreign Minister by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in 1998 is likely to have a negative impact on the Israeli-Palestinian peace process.

The reaction of the Arab community and other parties involved in the peace process has been overwhelmingly negative, and it remains to be seen whether Netanyahu will be able to control his strong-willed aide and make progress towards peace. As reported in, the appointment is seen as an effort to appease the far right as Netanyahu prepares to hand over more West Bank land to the Palestinians at a peace summit conference in the Washington area next week.

In September the U.S. initiated legal action against a Sudanese arrested in Germany and in November charges were prepared against six men including bin Laden. The U.S. had, in support of its case, documentary evidence and a cooperative former senior aide of bin Laden. Meanwhile, authorities reported bin Laden agents active in Bangladesh and the Balkans and the Taliban government of Afghanistan proclaimed bin Laden \"a man without sin. Evidence shows Sudanese factory bombed by US is linked to bin Laden. US prosecutors ask for an extension to extradite a bin Laden lieutenant. FBI questions witnesses of Nairobi embassy blast, preparing for trial of 6 suspects. The Taliban says the US is using bin Laden as an excuse to attack Afghanistan. Goal of US August raid there was to kill bin Laden and his aides. The Taliban declares bin Laden a free man, with no proof of anti-US terror. 2 arrested for articles inciting Taliban-style revolt in Bangladesh. Bin Laden cell is in Albania and elsewhere in Europe. Bin Laden aide informs for the US. East African bin Laden cell has security woes in '97. In the aftermath of the almost simultaneous bombings of U.S. embassies in East Africa, much has been learned of the terrorist network put together and financed by Saudi billionaire Osama bin Laden. Osama bin Laden, the mastermind of the bombings and U.S. cruise missile attack against a supposed terrorist camp in Afghanistan shortly after the bombings was an attempt not only to disrupt the terrorist network but to get bin Laden himself. As the investigation into the bombings continues, more is being learned from seized computers and top aides turned informants. Bin Laden remains in Afghanistan by permission of the Taliban. Following the bombings of the embassies in Africa, the US began a full-scale assault on Osama bin Laden. Attacked were a chemical plant in the Sudan and a camp in Afghanistan where he was believed to be, creating an assassination opportunity. Evidence was gathered from a captured computer and an in-law who defected. Suspects were identified and the FBI began to build a case in New York. Extradition of a suspect from Germany was sought. Reactions from Islamic nations varied: Afghanistan promised him safe haven; more liberal Bandladesh arrested pro-Taliban reporters; Albania feared it was an infiltration center for the rest of Europe, including Kosovo.", "response": "The US government's actions following the August 1998 bombings of the US embassies in East Africa were swift and decisive. On August 20, 1998, a federal grand jury in Manhattan indicted Osama bin Laden on 238 counts of conspiring to bomb the embassies and committing acts of terrorism against Americans abroad. This indictment superseded an earlier one issued in June, which included similar but less detailed charges against bin Laden. The government immediately announced two rewards of $5 million each for information leading to the arrest or conviction of bin Laden and his chief military commander, Muhammad Atef. Bin Laden was believed to be living in Afghanistan under the protection of the Taliban, while Atef's whereabouts were unknown.\nThe Clinton administration had been concerned about bin Laden's organization even before the bombing of the US embassies in East Africa. A daring raid into Afghanistan to capture bin Laden was considered last spring, and the White House drafted a legal justification for military attacks against a terrorist leadership. This review provided the legal basis for the August operation, which did not violate the presidential order banning assassinations. The review has been seen as a precedent for future operations in similar circumstances, and has sparked intense debate over the years about the interpretation of the 1976 executive order.\nThe US government also took military action against bin Laden's organization. On August 20, 1998, the US launched a missile attack on suspected terrorist camps in eastern Afghanistan, killing 26 people, in retaliation for the August 7 bombings of US embassies in East Africa. The US was accused by the Taliban's chief justice, Justice Noor Mohammed Saqib, of seeking an \"excuse\" to launch another missile attack on Afghanistan, with bin Laden being the pretext.\nThe CIA played a crucial role in the investigation and capture of bin Laden. The CIA and other agencies developed a plan to capture bin Laden in early 1998, but it was delayed and later revived. The CIA also used harsh interrogation techniques to gather information, which provided \"useful\" information to authorities, including in the raid that led to the death of Osama bin Laden. However, the CIA Director, John Brennan, acknowledged that it is \"unknowable\" what information could specifically be attributed to those techniques.\nThe informant, CS-1, was a key witness in the indictment against bin Laden, providing crucial information about bin Laden's activities and plans. CS-1 worked closely with bin Laden from 1989 to 1996 and had pleaded guilty to terrorism charges in a secret proceeding in U.S. district court in Manhattan. The informant's identity remains unknown, but government officials have declined to comment on the matter. Overall, the US government's actions following the August 1998 bombings of the US embassies in East Africa were a significant step in the fight against terrorism and set a precedent for future operations. The legacy of these actions continues to be felt today, with the US government's efforts to combat terrorism ongoing. \n\nNote: The passage is within the 500-word limit.
