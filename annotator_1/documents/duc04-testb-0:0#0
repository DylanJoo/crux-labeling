{"id": "duc04-testb-0:0#0", "contents": "Federal authorities investigating the murder of Dr. Barnett Slepian, a Buffalo-area obstetrician who performed abortions, have identified a Vermont man as a material witness to the sniper attack last month. James Charles Kopp, 44, whose last known address was in St. Albans, Vt., is believed to have information material to the case. His whereabouts are not known, and investigators have issued a warrant for his arrest to bring him in for questioning. Kopp's car was seen near Slepian's home in Amherst, N.Y., in the weeks before the doctor's murder. Kopp has a history of protesting at abortion clinics and has been linked to an underground manual that describes methods of killing or maiming doctors who perform abortions."}
