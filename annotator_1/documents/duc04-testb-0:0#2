The Justice Department and the FBI are working to step up the federal response to violence at abortion clinics, particularly in light of the upcoming Remembrance Day, a Canadian holiday that has been associated with some anti-abortion crimes. Attorney General Janet Reno is expected to announce the revival of a national investigative effort focused on abortion clinic violence, which was first established in 1995. The unit will aim to heighten the visibility of the federal role in cases that cross state and local jurisdictional boundaries."}
