{"id": "duc04-testb-0:1#4", "contents": "For Mrs. Lotempio and the approximately 80 abortion opponents in Buffalo, their protest is more like a job than a political activity. There is a schedule, and people count on them to show up. Mrs. Lotempio's involvement stems from a conversation in the 1970s, in which she helped a friend decide to abort an unwanted pregnancy. Two decades later, she was haunted by the question of whether the fetus was male or female, and she felt guilty for her role in the decision. She hopes that by being at the clinic, she can make up for that baby's life. During her 8 a.m.-to-10 a.m. shift, about a dozen people circled the area, saying the \"Hail Mary.\" Others take her spot on Tuesdays and Wednesdays, and she returns on Saturdays, when up to 40 people crowd the sidewalk."}
