Local protesters greet the security guard, Dick, by name, and they sometimes see the \"enemy\" \u2013 abortion-rights volunteers \u2013 in the supermarket or on the soccer field. Robert Behn, one of the protest leaders, even had a two-hour conversation with Dr. Slepian over breakfast last year. Despite their differences, the protesters and clinic staff have developed a familiar routine. Mrs. Lotempio and others like her are driven by a sense of conviction and a desire to make a difference, even if it's just one person at a time."}
