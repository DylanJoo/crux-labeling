One such individual is John Weslin, a prominent figure in the anti-abortion movement, who stayed with Mrs. Hayes in May 1996. During his stay, Weslin was arrested and later convicted of blocking access to a Rochester health clinic where abortions were performed. He served two and a half months in prison for his actions. Weslin's methods of protest included using a homemade device called \"the oven,\" made of cement and iron, to lock himself to the clinic, and other protesters also employed unconventional tactics, such as gluing their heads to locks on the clinic's gate."}
