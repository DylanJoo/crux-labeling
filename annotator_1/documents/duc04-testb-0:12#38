Kopp, who has been accused of violent crimes, has been housed by several families, including the Kennys, who took him in for two years. Despite his radical views and actions, Kopp has been described by those who have known him as a kind and humble person who is willing to make sacrifices for his beliefs. His defenders see him as a man who is driven by a desire to protect the unborn and are willing to overlook his more extreme actions in support of this cause."}
