Others are offering alternative explanations for the shooting, suggesting that the killer may have been someone overcome by grief or a disgruntled patient. One theory gaining traction among the Lambs is that the killing was a plot by abortion supporters to discredit the anti-abortion movement just before the elections. Mrs. Hayes acknowledged that while she doesn't know the truth, it's possible that the killer was a lone individual who was drawn to the same cause as the Lambs, but not necessarily affiliated with them."}
