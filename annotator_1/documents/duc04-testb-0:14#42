When Father Weslin first arrived two years ago, he brought new focus to a group that often had done little more than counsel pregnant women and set up booths on college campuses. With his leadership, the group was able to come together and feel like they were doing something sacrificial to fight against abortion. Mrs. Quinn noted that in many cities, there is a priest for life coordinating and leading rosary marches against abortion, but with Father Weslin's presence, the group in Rochester was finally able to organize and take action."}
