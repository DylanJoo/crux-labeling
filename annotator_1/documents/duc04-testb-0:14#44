{"id": "duc04-testb-0:14#44", "contents": "Mrs. Hayes described the partial-birth abortion procedure, which she finds brutal and inhumane. She explained that the procedure involves getting the shoulders out in order to puncture the head, resulting in the death of the child. She emphasized that the purpose of the procedure is to kill the baby, and that doctors who perform it are trying to murder a child. Mrs. Hayes' strong feelings against abortion are evident in her words, and she is not alone in her conviction. The Lambs of Christ and other anti-abortion groups continue to protest and fight against abortion, despite the challenges and controversies surrounding the issue."}
