The task force, comprising a dozen Justice Department lawyers, will work with several law-enforcement agencies, with the FBI taking the lead in investigating the shooting and its potential connection to a larger pattern of organized violence. However, many FBI agents have expressed concerns about the investigation, fearing it may blur the line between inquiries into criminal activity and those into political causes and unpopular ideas."}
