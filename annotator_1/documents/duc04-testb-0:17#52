Senior agency officials, including Director Louis Freeh, are wary of being drawn into the ideological war between anti-abortion groups and abortion rights advocates. They are also skeptical about the existence of a conspiracy to kill doctors who perform abortions, citing the lack of evidence in previous investigations. The FBI has found itself navigating a minefield of politically charged cases involving extremist groups, and some officials believe that the agency is too quick to jump from investigating crime to investigating political association."}
