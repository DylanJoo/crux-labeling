{"id": "duc04-testb-0:18#54", "contents": "When Randall Terry drove to Atlanta in July 1988 to start the anti-abortion protests that would put his new group, Operation Rescue, onto America's front pages, James Charles Kopp was in the van riding alongside him. According to former leaders of Operation Rescue, Kopp followed Terry into jail when Terry was arrested on the first day of Operation Rescue's \"Siege of Atlanta.\" Kopp remained in jail for 40 days, adhering to Terry's orders not to give a real name to the police or courts. After his release, Kopp returned to Operation Rescue's Binghamton headquarters, working alongside Terry as the group's power and influence in the anti-abortion movement surged in late 1988 and 1989."}
