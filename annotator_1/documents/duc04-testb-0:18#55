{"id": "duc04-testb-0:18#55", "contents": "Now, Kopp is being sought by federal and local law enforcement authorities for questioning as a material witness in the murder of an obstetrician who performed abortions in the Buffalo region. Authorities also believe he may have information that will help solve four other sniper attacks on doctors who performed abortions in Canada and upstate New York. Some abortion-rights groups are seizing on Kopp's role in Operation Rescue to raise new questions about the connections between the recent anti-abortion violence and the hard-line anti-abortion protest groups that emerged in the late 1980s. Federal law enforcement officials hope that Kopp may help provide a link between these groups and the violence."}
