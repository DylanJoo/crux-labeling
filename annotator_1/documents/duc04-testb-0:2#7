Additionally, the number of doctors performing abortions has decreased, with only two doctors in the area now performing the procedure as a significant part of their practice. While the daily demonstrators view this as progress, they acknowledge that they witness far more abortions than successful interventions, with only eight women changing their minds in eight years."}
