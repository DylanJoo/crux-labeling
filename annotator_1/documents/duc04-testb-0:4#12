{"id": "duc04-testb-0:4#12", "contents": "Dr. Barnett Slepian, an obstetrician and gynecologist, endured a significant amount of stress due to his work as an abortion doctor. He faced harassment from strangers, protesters, and demonstrators who would often call him a \"murderer\" or \"baby killer.\" Despite the strain, Slepian rarely acknowledged it and instead would occasionally crack jokes about the protesters. He even went as far as inviting an anti-abortion leader to breakfast or stopping to chat with a familiar demonstrator outside the clinic. Slepian's persistence in his work, despite the pressure from abortion opponents, was a testament to his commitment to providing comprehensive health care to women."}
