He was also incredibly stubborn and believed that women had a right to comprehensive health care, and as a women's doctor, he was going to provide it for them. Slepian's niece, H. Amanda Robb, said that he was a conservative who advocated for old-fashioned values like self-reliance and was a shy man who had rare flashes of anger. He was not a crusader in either politics or medicine, but rather an obstinate, unassuming man who refused to allow anyone to dictate what kind of doctor he should be."}
