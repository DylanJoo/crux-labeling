He was the third doctor to be killed in the last five years in bombings and shootings that had killed 7 people and wounded 17 at abortion clinics around the nation. Slepian's death was a tragic reminder of the emotional and politicized nature of the abortion debate, and his legacy serves as a testament to his commitment to providing comprehensive health care to women, even in the face of adversity."}
