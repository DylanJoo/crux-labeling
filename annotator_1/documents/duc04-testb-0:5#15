{"id": "duc04-testb-0:5#15", "contents": "Dr. Slepian's background played a significant role in shaping his views and actions. His family, despite struggling financially, had high expectations for success. To support himself through medical school, Slepian took on various jobs, including shoveling muck at a ranch and driving a taxi. He formed lasting friendships with those he met, and was known for his dedication to his friends and their families. Slepian chose obstetrics as his specialty, citing that it exposed him to the least suffering, and performed abortions because it was legal and a better alternative. However, he often expressed frustration with women who repeatedly sought abortions, and those who had multiple children without means of support."}
