His family valued education above all else, and his father decreed that his sons would become doctors or earn Ph.D's. Slepian's grandfather, a Russian Jewish immigrant, had propelled all five of his sons into Harvard, setting a high standard for the family. Despite their high expectations, the family struggled financially. Slepian's father, Philip, had initially worked in the family business, but after it failed, he became a freelance writer, researching and writing stories for small-town newspapers. The family's means did not match their aspirations, and Slepian's father continued to write until his death at the age of 93."}
