He lived with his sister Serena in Reno, working various jobs such as driving a cab, cleaning barns, and working as a laboratory assistant. After graduating, he moved to Buffalo for his medical residency and eventually established his own obstetrics practice. He was known for his soothing and unhurried manner, taking the time to help his patients overcome their fears and concerns. One patient, Patti Durlak, recalled how Slepian helped her overcome her fear of insulin injections, calling her every few days for months to offer support and guidance."}
