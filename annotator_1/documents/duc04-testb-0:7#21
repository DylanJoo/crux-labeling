The protests even affected his personal life, with demonstrators jeering at him from the sidewalk in front of his home as he opened Hanukkah presents with his children in 1988. The doctor, who had never been one to make a public fuss, responded angrily, brandishing a baseball bat, and was subsequently ordered to repair a protester's smashed van window and pay a portion of another's medical bills. His outburst surprised his family and friends, as it was not in line with his usual behavior. His brother Paul noted that the family never discussed stress, except as an engineering term, and that the doctor had always viewed the protests as a nuisance."}
