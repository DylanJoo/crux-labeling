She expressed rage to The Buffalo News shortly after the shooting, stating that whoever had killed her husband deserved the death penalty and that she would be happy to administer the lethal injection herself. She also denounced Robert Schenck, the brother of an anti-abortion leader, as a hypocrite after he sent a bouquet of flowers. Slepian's lawyer, Glenn Edward Murray, noted that the doctor had tried to engage his critics and cut through the venom, but ultimately, his efforts were unsuccessful. The doctor's conversation with Rev. Behn, in which he was asked how performing abortions affected him spiritually, was inconclusive, and Behn dismissed Slepian's gesture as an attempt to get people to like him."}
