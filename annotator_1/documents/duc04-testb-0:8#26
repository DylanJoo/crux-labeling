He took the warning seriously, but did not share his concerns with his staff. The clinic reopened five days after his death, and protesters returned, a routine that Slepian had grown accustomed to. Clinic director Marilynne Buckham remembered Slepian's dedication to his work and his commitment to ending each day on a positive note. \"He never wanted a day to end on a bad note,\" she said."}
