{"id": "duc04-testb-0:9#27", "contents": "The killing of Dr. Barnett Slepian, a key figure in Buffalo's only abortion clinic, has not eliminated access to abortion in the area, but rather has highlighted the complex reality of abortion availability in the United States. Middle-class and affluent women can typically obtain abortions from their private gynecologists or through referrals, whereas poor, young, or uneducated women rely on specialized clinics or hospitals. As a result of the fear generated by Slepian's killing and the slayings of five other doctors and clinic workers since 1993, medical experts note that abortion is becoming less accessible to the latter group."}
