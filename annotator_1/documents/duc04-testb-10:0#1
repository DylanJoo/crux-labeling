Police reported that most victims choked to death on smoke and poisonous gases, with 59 bodies found at the scene and six others dying later. Of the injured, 57 were in intensive care. The victims represented at least 19 nationalities, including Somalis, Ethiopians, Iraqis, Iranians, and Swedes. The Macedonian Association, which rented the facility, had in turn rented it out to others for the dance, but the person responsible has not been identified."}
