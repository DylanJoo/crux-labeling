{"id": "duc04-testb-10:2#6", "contents": "Forensic experts examining heavily burned bodies were able to identify more of the 60 young people who died in a dance hall fire, but the catastrophe's most tormenting question was still unanswered: what caused the flames that raced through a hall packed far beyond capacity, blocking one of the exits and forcing panicked teenagers to flee down the one remaining staircase and leap out of second-story windows? Goteborg chief prosecutor Ulf Noren said that as long as the technicians hadn't established the cause of the fire, it was unclear whether it was arson or not. Noren had earlier stated that there was a \"50-50\" chance that the fire was arson, prompting wide speculation that authorities had tracked down new clues, but he later retracted the remark, saying he'd meant only that no possibilities were being excluded."}
