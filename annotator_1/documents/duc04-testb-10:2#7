{"id": "duc04-testb-10:2#7", "contents": "As investigators worked to find the cause of the fire, examiners identified another 22 of the bodies, bringing the total to 40, and officials said 49 people were released from hospital. Of the 162 people who suffered non-fatal injuries in the Thursday night fire, 76 remain hospitalized. Most of the victims were immigrants or of immigrant parentage, from countries including Iraq, Iran, Somalia, Ethiopia, and current and former Yugoslavia. The first call alerting authorities to the fire was made in heavily accented Swedish, which delayed the fire squads' response by several minutes. Per-Olof Ortarsen of Goteborg's emergency services line said the call was so hard to understand that it took three minutes for workers to figure out what was going on and where to send fire trucks."}
