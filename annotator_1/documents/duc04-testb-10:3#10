The fire apparently began with an explosion, and its rapid spread suggested that it was not a normal fire. The building had only two exits, one of which was blocked by the fire, leading to a panic as youths trampled each other to escape. Police reported that some youths even jumped from windows in desperation. The rescue efforts were hindered by the fact that many of the victims were not carrying identification, making it difficult to identify them."}
