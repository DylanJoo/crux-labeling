Relatives and friends were forced to wait for hours at hospitals, with many waiting in corridors, crying and searching for their loved ones. The blaze shocked a country known for its calmness, with King Carl XVI Gustaf sending a statement expressing sympathy for the victims' relatives. Prime Minister Goeran Persson visited the fire site, laying flowers and walking into the gutted building. A memorial service was held at Goteborg Cathedral on Friday evening, attended by about 1,500 mostly young people."}
