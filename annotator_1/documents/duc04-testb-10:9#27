Police earlier had reported 65 dead, but backed off that figure Friday evening. The fast-spreading fire that broke out just a few minutes before midnight Thursday gutted the building and left rescuers facing a hideous scene that local rescue service leader Lennart Olin likened to a \"gas chamber.\" The cause of the fire had not been determined as of Friday evening."}
