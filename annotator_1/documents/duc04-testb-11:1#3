The decision was made after Lee \"gave much thought\" to an invitation from Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, according to the Foreign Ministry. This is an annual formality, as the host nation presents an invitation to Lee with the understanding that it will be politely refused, allowing Taiwan to maintain a semblance of dignity and the host to avoid controversy with China."}
