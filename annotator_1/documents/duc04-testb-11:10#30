Members of the U.S.-ASEAN Business Council expressed confidence in Thailand's economic future, assuring that their companies would continue to invest in the region. The council's chairman, George David, commended the proposed economic reform packages, stating that they were \"aggressive\" and \"impressive.\" The reforms aim to address the massive bad debt of private companies, which has hindered Thailand's recovery from last year's Asian economic crisis."}
