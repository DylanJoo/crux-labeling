Japan, the world's second-largest economy and Asia's financial anchor, is suffering through its worst recession since World War II, and its prime minister has lost his job. Indonesia, the world's fourth most populous country, is also in financial trouble after a violent, pro-democracy movement drove out its long-time ruler, Suharto.
