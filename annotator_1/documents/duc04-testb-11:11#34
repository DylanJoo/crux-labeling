Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, who has been in power for 17 years, has dismissed his expected successor, Anwar Ibrahim, and jailed him on corruption and sex crime charges. The move has sparked big rallies demanding Mahathir's resignation and has been criticized by APEC members such as Australia, Indonesia, the Philippines, and the United States. The trial of Anwar Ibrahim is scheduled to take place during the APEC summit, which may further complicate the meeting."}
