The city, located in the heart of Southeast Asia, has become a focal point of controversy after Malaysia's Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad implemented capital controls on September 1. The move, which restricted trading in the Malaysian currency, the ringgit, and limited foreign investment in the stock and currency markets, was met with criticism from international investors and policymakers. They argued that the controls would hinder Malaysia's economic reforms and isolate the country from the global economy."}
