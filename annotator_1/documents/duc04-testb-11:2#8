The Malaysian Prime Minister has been vocal in his criticism of the global financial system and has argued that countries need to insulate themselves from its negative effects. His views have gained some support from officials in Japan and economists like Paul Krugman, who have advocated for the use of capital controls as an emergency measure. However, policymakers in the United States have expressed concerns that if Malaysia's gambit is seen as successful, other economically weakened countries in the region may be tempted to follow suit."}
