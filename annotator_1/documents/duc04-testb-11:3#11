Much of the foreign capital that was in the country had already left, and the controls have spooked would-be investors without locking in the ones who used to be there. Other Asian currencies, such as the Indonesian rupiah and the Thai baht, have actually rebounded since Malaysia suspended trading in its currency and fixed the exchange rate. The capital controls are also slowing down much-needed corporate and banking reforms, and the government's rescue of Renong, a major conglomerate with close ties to Mahathir, remains a contentious issue."}
