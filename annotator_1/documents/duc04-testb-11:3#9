However, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's imposition of capital controls in September 1998 helped to stabilize the economy. The controls, which included a fixed exchange rate of 3.8 ringgit to the dollar, were aimed at preventing a repeat of the 1997 crisis, which had been triggered by a flight of capital out of the country. Yusof, a Malaysian economist, noted that the Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM) fiasco in the US, which had been caused by a series of wrong bets on Treasury securities, provided a case study of what could go wrong in the global economy. With capital controls in place, Malaysia was able to improve its trade balance and revive consumer purchases of durable goods."}
