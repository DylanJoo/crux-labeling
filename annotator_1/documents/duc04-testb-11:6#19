{"id": "duc04-testb-11:6#19", "contents": "Anwar Ibrahim is a charismatic politician who was once picked to be the successor to Malaysia's long-serving Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad. However, he was suddenly fired by Mahathir on Sept. 2 after the two differed on economic policy. He then began speaking out against Mahathir and was arrested Sept. 20. Anwar has been accused of engaging in homosexual acts illegal under Malaysia law, but the charges are generally seen as a pretext for his political persecution. In a court appearance last week, Anwar's face was bruised and he said he had been beaten by police, heightening international attention to his case."}
