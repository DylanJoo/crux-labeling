He also questioned the basis of Anwar's dismissal, saying that it should not have been based ``on things which had not been proven.'' On attending the APEC meeting, Habibie said, ``It's difficult for me.'' However, he would consult parliament, adding, ``I'm not coming personally but as the president of 211 million people of Indonesia.'' Habibie's concerns are shared by Philippine President Joseph Estrada, who is also considering not attending the APEC meeting due to Anwar's arrest."}
