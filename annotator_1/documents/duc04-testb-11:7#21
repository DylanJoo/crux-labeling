The luncheon, planned for the end of the two-day summit, will offer a taste of Malaysia's spicy delicacies. The menu includes satay kajang, a beef or chicken kebab in peanut sauce, ayam percik, a chicken curry with chilies, and soto ayam, a Malaysian chicken soup. Additionally, fried rice \"village-style\" will be served. For dessert, fresh tropical fruit will be the simple yet refreshing choice."}
