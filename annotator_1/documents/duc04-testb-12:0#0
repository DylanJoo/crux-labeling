The airport was officially opened with the landing of an Egypt Air plane at 8:30 a.m. (0630 GMT) on the desert tarmac in the southern Gaza Strip. The emotional highlight of the event was the touchdown of the first Palestinian Airlines plane, a Fokker 50, with the pilot and co-pilot raising Palestinian flags high above their heads as they descended the stairway. A chant of \"Allahu Akbar,\" or God is Great, rose from the crowd of thousands of Palestinians who had gathered to join the celebrations."}
