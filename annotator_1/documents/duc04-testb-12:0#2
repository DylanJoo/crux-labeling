The airport has been designed in an Oriental style with graceful arches and elaborate tiles imported from Morocco, and features a single passenger terminal, a VIP lounge, and a three-kilometer-long runway. Palestine Airlines will begin direct flights to Jordan, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia next week, and the airport is expected to ease travel restrictions for Palestinians, who previously had to obtain permission to enter Israel and fly out of Ben Gurion International airport near Tel Aviv."}
