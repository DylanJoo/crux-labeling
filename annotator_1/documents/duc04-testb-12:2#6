The incident occurred at the Yasser Arafat International Airport in the Gaza Strip, which is the only Palestinian airport and a vital transportation hub for the territory. The airport has been the site of several Israeli-Palestinian agreements, including a 1998 deal that allowed for the airport's construction and operation. Despite the challenges, the airport remains a crucial link between Gaza and the outside world."}
