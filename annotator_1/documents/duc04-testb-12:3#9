As part of the latest Mideast peace accord, Israeli and Palestinian officials were to sign a protocol for the airport Friday and Palestinian negotiators said Gaza International Airport would open Sunday. The airport has been nearly completed for months. On Thursday, officials added a few extra touches of yellow paint and fresh flowers. It was not clear who would be the first arrivals at the airport. Officials said Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat may travel by car to Egypt in order to fly into the airport."}
