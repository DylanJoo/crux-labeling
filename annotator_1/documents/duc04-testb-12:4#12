Gaza International Airport is set to open on Sunday, following the signing of a protocol by Israeli and Palestinian officials on Friday. The airport has been nearly completed for months, with officials adding the final touches, including yellow paint and fresh flowers. However, it is not clear who will be the first arrivals at the airport. Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat may travel by car to Egypt and then fly into the airport, while others suggest the first international flight may be reserved for U.S. President Bill Clinton, who is scheduled to visit Gaza in December."}
