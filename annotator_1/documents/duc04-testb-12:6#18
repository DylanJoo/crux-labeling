According to Civilian Airport Authority Director Nir Yarkoni, Palestinian airport workers refused to allow Israeli security officials to check the identity of passengers who arrived on an Egyptian plane on Sunday afternoon. The plane carried mostly Palestinian Authority employees. As a result, the Transportation Minister instructed Yarkoni to inform the Palestinians that if this continues, the airport will not be allowed to operate."}
