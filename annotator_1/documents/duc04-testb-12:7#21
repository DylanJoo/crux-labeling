The control tower lacks controls, the check-in counter has no computers, and the runway cannot function after dark due to a lack of floodlights. However, with a little improvisation and a lot of patriotic pride, the airport is ready to welcome its first flights. Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat is expected to be on hand when a plane from Cairo carrying Egyptian officials arrives as the first flight. Six more planes from countries such as Morocco and Spain will follow at half-hour intervals. The European Union, which donated $38 million for equipment and training, is also sending its Mideast envoy on a special plane."}
