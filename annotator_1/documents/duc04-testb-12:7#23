The equipment for the control tower, check-in counters, and floodlights is still at the Israeli port of Ashdod. Nir Yarkoni, a spokesman for Israel's Civil Aviation Authority, acknowledged delays in the equipment's arrival but did not provide a reason. Tomer Degani attributed the delay to customs. Despite these challenges, the airport is expected to operate, albeit with some temporary arrangements in place."}
