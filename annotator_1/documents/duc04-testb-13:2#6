The ceremony began with a torch relay led by Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai, followed by a three-hour show featuring 7,614 performers, with a theme of \"Friendship Beyond Frontiers.\" The king, the world's longest-reigning monarch, was upstaged by Japan's Naoko Takahashi, who won the games' first gold medal in the marathon. The ceremony also included a martial arts display celebrating Asian unity, and hundreds of primary school students introduced the games' mascot, \"Chai-yo.\" The field was transformed into a swirl of giant snakes, swans, birds, and angels, with fireworks bursting overhead and searchlights playing across the stadium."}
