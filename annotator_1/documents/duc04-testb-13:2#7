The king composed some of the music played by the Bangkok Symphony Orchestra and anointed a plaque for the Royal Main Stadium. The athletes' parade featured teams from 41 nations, with each team led by a Thai beauty queen holding its signboard. However, the parade was not without incident, as five of the women collapsed, and three were taken out on stretchers. The ceremony concluded with the lighting of a giant cauldron, which was lit by touching a torch to a smaller cauldron inside a model of a temple."}
