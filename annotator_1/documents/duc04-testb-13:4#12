According to Santiparb Tejavanija, deputy secretary of the Bangkok Asian Games Organizing Committee, construction of the sports complex at the Muang Thong Thani housing estate is 95 percent complete and is expected to be finished by the end of the month. The complex's completion was previously threatened by liquidity problems at Bangkok Land, the company responsible for the housing estate. However, the issue has been resolved through the allocation of 200 million baht (approximately $5 million) worth of credit guarantees from a scrapped project."}
