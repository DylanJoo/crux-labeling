Merchant protested, and with the referee refusing to reverse his decision, he sought help from the Indian team. Several team members went to the playing arena, and one of them wrote a quick protest letter using the snooker table as a writing platform. The incident was viewed as a breach of snooker etiquette, with Pakistani team manager Shahnawaz Khan expressing his disgust at the behavior of the Indian team. Khan stated that Pakistani team officials did not intervene, instead staying in their allocated seats, and that they had also lodged a formal complaint."}
