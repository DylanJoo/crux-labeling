The proposal to send a symbolic delegation was made by Sheik Ahmad al-Fahd al Sabah, president of the Olympic Council of Asia, who is a friend of Prince Faisal bin Fahd, Saudi Arabia's top sports official. Prince Faisal is currently studying the proposal to send a small team to the Dec. 6-20 Games. The initial withdrawal of Saudi Arabia's 105-member team was a surprise to hosts Thailand, who remain skeptical about the official reasons offered. Saudi sports authorities cited the conflict with national centenary celebrations and the Muslim holy month of Ramadan as the reason for their withdrawal."}
