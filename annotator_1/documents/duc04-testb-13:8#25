From taxi drivers to local tourist magazines distributed free at hotels, there are messengers aplenty to advertise massage parlors and escort services. Minutely detailed photo albums seek to arouse sensual fantasies. Estimates of the number of female sex workers in Thailand, a country of 60 million, range from more than 300,000 to 2 million.
