Secretary-General Kofi Annan has condemned the \"systematic terror\" inflicted on Kosovo civilians in recent days, attributing the violence primarily to Yugoslav forces. Annan acknowledged that he lacked the necessary means to provide an independent assessment of compliance as required by the Security Council. He suggested that the 15 members of the Security Council may need to make their own judgment on the matter. Meanwhile, U.S. special envoy Richard Holbrooke met with Solana in Brussels, Belgium, and expressed his concerns about the situation in Kosovo."}
