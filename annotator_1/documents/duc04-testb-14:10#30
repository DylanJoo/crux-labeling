The report notes that the rebels have also violated the laws of war, but on a lesser scale than the government abuses. The report's author, Fred Abrahams, concluded that the guerrillas' violations included taking civilian hostages and carrying out summary executions. The report highlights a watershed in the conflict, specifically the attack by police forces on three ethnic Albanian villages in late February and early March in the Drenica region of central Kosovo. At least 83 people, including 24 women and children, were killed in the attack, which involved helicopters, artillery, and armored personnel carriers."}
