However, there are areas in central Kosovo, particularly around Likovac and Gornje Obrinje, that have been ruled off-limits due to the presence of land mines on the roads. These mines are believed to have been planted by the guerrillas. Gornje Obrinje was the site of a massacre of 18 ethnic Albanian women, children, and elderly people on September 26. A British reporter who visited the village on Sunday reported that about 10 mortar shells, apparently from the Serbian police or the Yugoslav army, were fired at the village early Sunday afternoon."}
