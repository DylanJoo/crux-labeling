{"id": "duc04-testb-14:11#33", "contents": "Yugoslavia's prime minister warned Monday the nation faces the ``imminent danger of war'' and claimed the government was taking steps to comply with international demands for peace in Kosovo. In New York, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said ``systematic terror'' had been inflicted on Kosovo civilians within recent days and that Yugoslav forces were mostly responsible. But Annan said he did not ``have the means necessary to provide an independent assessment of compliance as required by the Security Council'' and suggested the 15 members may want to make their ``own judgement in this respect.'' Meanwhile, U.S. special envoy Richard Holbrooke said the situation in the southern Serbian province was as bad now as two weeks ago. Holbrooke spoke in Brussels, Belgium en route to Belgrade, where he planned to drive home to Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic ``the extreme gravity of the situation.''"}
