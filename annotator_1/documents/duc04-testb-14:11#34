Kosovo is a province of Serbia, the main republic of Yugoslavia. ``The threats are serious,'' Prime Minister Momir Bulatovic said. ``And I call on this parliament to conclude that Yugoslavia is faced with the imminent danger of war. Yugoslavia has to defend itself if it was attacked.'' One option could be for parliament to declare a state of emergency _ a step which could lead to a general mobilization of all military-aged men. In an attempt to head off NATO action, Bulatovic said the government had accepted a Russian proposal for the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe to investigate the crisis."}
