A Western diplomat said up to 120 Yugoslav army armored vehicles, including tanks, have been pulled out. Belgrade had been counting on Russia to block any U.N.-sanctioned military moves by the Western Alliance. However, Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov and Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev warned that airstrikes could occur ``if decisive measures are not immediately taken for a radical improvement of the situation.'' To avoid such an attack, Yugoslavia must end the hostilities, withdraw army and security forces, take urgent measures to overcome the humanitarian crisis, ensure that refugees can return home and take part in peace talks."}
