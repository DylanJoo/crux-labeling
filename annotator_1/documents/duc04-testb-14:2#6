According to American diplomats, Holbrooke told Milosevic that he must take further steps to withdraw his military from Kosovo Province or face a NATO attack. Milosevic was also instructed to ensure that the approximately 250,000 ethnic Albanian refugees who have fled their homes in the past six months be allowed to return home. However, many of these refugees are hesitant to return due to the presence of Serb police officers who destroyed their homes and villages. After the meeting, Holbrooke stated that NATO's military plans for attacking Serbia were moving ahead on a \"serious, intense, and sustained basis.\""}
