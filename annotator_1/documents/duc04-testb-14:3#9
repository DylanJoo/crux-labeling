Yugoslav generals have put the nation's air defense on high alert, but have attempted a compromise by moving some tanks and heavy equipment out of the province. Up to 120 Yugoslav army armored vehicles, including tanks, have been withdrawn. However, US special envoy Richard Holbrooke stated that the situation in Kosovo remains as dire as it was two weeks ago, and that the capacity for resumed fighting is still present."}
