The United States and its allies have been criticized for their delayed response to the crisis, waiting four months before taking action. Morton Abramowitz, head of the International Crisis Group, stated that the delay allowed Milosevic to gain the upper hand, and that NATO's failure to follow through on its earlier threat in June emboldened him to launch a full-scale offensive against the Kosovo Liberation Army."}
