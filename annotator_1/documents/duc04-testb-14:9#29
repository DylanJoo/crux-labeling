Instead, Washington has worked with Moscow to establish a monitoring presence in Kosovo, but this has been slow to materialize and ineffective in preventing the violence. The monitors have faced roadblocks and been unable to gain access to the fighting, and it was not until the Yugoslav army withdrew in recent days that they were able to move more freely. The crisis in Kosovo remains unresolved, with the Albanian population continuing to suffer and the international community struggling to find a way forward."}
