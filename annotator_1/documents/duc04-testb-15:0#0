His death sparked nationwide outrage, vigils, and debates over hate-crimes legislation. President Clinton called for federal hate-crimes legislation, and the incident fueled discussions in Western states, including Wyoming, that have resisted such laws. From Denver to the University of Maryland, people gathered to honor Shepard, who became a symbol of anti-gay violence."}
