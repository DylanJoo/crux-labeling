Kreifels recalled that he was on a mountain bike ride in public lands east of Laramie when he stumbled upon Shepard, who was lying on the ground, face up, unconscious, with his hands bound behind his back with a nylon cord and tied to a fence post. Kreifels reflected on the experience, saying, ``Sometimes I wonder why I found him alive, if he was going to die.'' He had traveled to spend the weekend at home, still grappling with the aftermath of the tragic event."}
