The University of Wyoming football team will wear yellow and green stickers on their helmets in memory of Shepard, symbolizing tolerance and peace. In Casper, a conservative city, tolerance has become a key issue. The local newspaper, The Casper Star-Tribune, wrote that prejudice against homosexuals is \"just as redneck as anti-black bias,\" and that violence against the gay community has created a climate of fear. The newspaper's political reporter, Jason Marsden, remembered Shepard fondly, recalling his small stature and big hugs."}
