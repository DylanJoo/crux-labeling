Elizabeth Birch, executive director of the Human Rights Campaign, hopes that Shepard's death will lead to a better understanding of hate crime laws and result in legislation that protects individuals from violence based on their sexual orientation. According to the Southern Poverty Law Center, 21 men and women were killed in the United States in 1996 because of their sexual orientation, and the FBI reported that sexual orientation was a factor in 11.6 percent of hate crimes that year."}
