His cousin, Rev. Anne Kitch, delivered a homily that highlighted Matt's selfless spirit, saying, \"Matt believed that if he had made one person's life better, he had succeeded.\" The service was carried beyond the packed pews of St. Mark's Episcopal Church to a wider audience through a parish hall, a nearby Presbyterian church, and a local AM radio station. Rev. Kitch noted that Matt's impact would be felt by thousands, given the outpouring of support from around the world."}
