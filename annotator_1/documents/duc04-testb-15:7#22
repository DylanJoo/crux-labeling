{"id": "duc04-testb-15:7#22", "contents": "Shepard, who was openly gay, had attended a meeting of the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgendered Association hours before the attack. He had been sitting at a bar, having a beer, when two men approached him, claiming to be gay. Shepard indicated he was gay, and the men allegedly attacked him. Shepard's friends described him as courageous for being openly gay in a town where it was not widely accepted. Laramie police say the attack was not a hate crime, but rather a robbery gone wrong. However, Shepard's friends and many in the community believe it was a hate crime."}
