{"id": "duc04-testb-15:7#23", "contents": "Laramie, Wyoming, is a town where openly gay behavior is discouraged and can be dangerous. The state legislature has repeatedly voted down hate crime legislation, and the town's attitude towards homosexuality is hostile. Shepard, who was born in Casper, Wyoming, and spent time in Switzerland and Denver, found it difficult to adjust to life in Laramie. He joined the campus gay association and frequented the Fireside Bar, which drew a mixed crowd. The attack on Shepard has left the community struggling to understand the incident and has raised questions about the town's attitude towards homosexuality."}
