Shepard's friends call the attack a hate crime. Before the attack, Shepard had attended a meeting of the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgendered Association, where he met the two men who would later assault him. The men posed as homosexuals and lured Shepard out to McKinney's pickup truck, where they beat him and drove him to an isolated area, tying him to a fence post and pistol-whipping him with a .357 magnum."}
