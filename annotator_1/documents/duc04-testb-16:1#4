The telemarketer, Nancy, claimed to be calling on behalf of Speaker Gingrich, who is pushing legislation to cut taxes and capital gains. She invited the doctor to be an honorary chairman on Gingrich's advisory council, promising correspondence and input on legislation. Nancy also mentioned that as a member of the committee, the doctor would receive the national leadership award, but would be asked to make a one-time contribution of $500 or $1,000 to support Gingrich's media campaign."}
