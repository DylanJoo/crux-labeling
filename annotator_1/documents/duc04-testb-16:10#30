He has stopped apologizing for his conduct with Monica Lewinsky, instead making glancing references to it before moving on to attack the Republican Congress as indifferent to Americans' needs. Clinton's remarks were made at a series of fund-raisers, including one in Cleveland where he raised about $200,000 for the Democratic Senate candidate in Ohio, Mary Boyle."}
