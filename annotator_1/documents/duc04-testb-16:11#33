Alfonse D'Amato, the New York Republican running for re-election, recently accepted an award from mass-transit advocates at Manhattan's Grand Central Terminal. However, the reporters in attendance showed more interest in his potential vote on an impeachment of President Clinton rather than the award. D'Amato responded by stating that he would not comment on the subject matter, citing his role as a senator who may be called upon to make a decision. As a candidate in one of the tightest Senate races in the nation, D'Amato's response is not unique, with similar questions being asked in Senate races around the country."}
