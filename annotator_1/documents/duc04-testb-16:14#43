Most of these measures have little chance of becoming law, but members hope to turn them to their advantage on Election Day. There are also quieter measures that sponsors hope will not attract attention, often special-interest matters that members hope will escape scrutiny in the rush to leave town. The impeachment inquiry has given these sponsors cover to move their pet causes into the omnibus package that will eventually be presented to Clinton for signing."}
