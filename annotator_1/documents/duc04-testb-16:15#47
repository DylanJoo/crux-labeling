Schumer will receive thousands of dollars from the local as well as use of its renowned phone banks, which can make 50,000 political calls a day. D'Amato's campaign responded by highlighting his endorsements from over 100 union federations and locals, representing more than 400,000 working men and women. Schumer also received the endorsement of 1199's parent union, the Service Employees International Union, which has 350,000 members in New York State."}
