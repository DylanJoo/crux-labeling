White House officials said they did not know whether the three had made such appeals, and Human Rights Campaign officials declined to comment. Schumer's supporters are hoping that the group will either endorse both candidates or make no endorsement at all. The Human Rights Campaign is considered the most influential gay and lesbian organization in Washington, with a national membership of 250,000 and an annual budget of more than $13 million."}
