{"id": "duc04-testb-16:18#55", "contents": "The Human Rights Campaign's endorsement process has been influenced by its past decisions, including the precedent set in the 1996 Massachusetts Senate race where the organization endorsed Democrat John F. Kerry over Republican William Weld, despite Weld's stronger record on gay rights. This move angered gay Republicans, who now argue that the group is biased towards Democrats. However, many Human Rights Campaign contributors and board members are strongly opposed to endorsing D'Amato, citing his opposition to abortion and his role in promoting anti-gay policies in New York state. They fear that endorsing D'Amato would damage the group's reputation, particularly among women and gay activists."}
