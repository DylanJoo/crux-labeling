They argue that D'Amato's opposition to abortion and his role in promoting anti-gay policies in New York state would outweigh any potential benefits of a Human Rights Campaign endorsement. Matt Foreman, executive director of the Empire State Pride Agenda, has also spoken out against endorsing D'Amato, citing his role as \"the architect\" of the state Republican Party and his responsibility for promoting anti-gay policies in the state."}
