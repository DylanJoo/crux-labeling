{"id": "duc04-testb-16:19#57", "contents": "George Voinovich, a Republican who previously served as the governor of Ohio, is now running for the Senate seat held by retiring Democrat John Glenn. Voinovich's previous electoral success, winning re-election as governor with 72% of the vote, has led many to believe he is well-positioned to increase the Republican majority in the Senate. His Democratic opponent, Mary Boyle, is running a grass-roots campaign, despite being at a financial disadvantage, having raised nearly $2 million compared to Voinovich's nearly $7 million. Boyle is focusing on the issue of education, criticizing Voinovich for his handling of the state's schools and his support for a proposal to raise the state's sales tax by one percent."}
