She criticizes his decision to support a proposal to raise the state's sales tax by one percent, which was unpopular with voters. Boyle also discusses the Ohio Supreme Court's ruling that cited wide disparities in the quality of the state's schools and ruled unconstitutional the formula for funding them. Despite her efforts, Boyle trails Voinovich by 15-20 percentage points in some polls and faces a significant fund-raising disparity."}
