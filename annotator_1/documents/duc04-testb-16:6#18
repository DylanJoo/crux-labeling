Schumer's rating by the organization has consistently been better than D'Amato's, particularly in York. However, both candidates have faced criticism from gay rights advocates for voting for legislation that allows states to not recognize gay marriages. A precedent for the organization's decision can be seen in the 1996 Massachusetts Senate race, where they endorsed Sen. John F. Kerry over William Weld, despite Weld's stronger record on gay rights."}
