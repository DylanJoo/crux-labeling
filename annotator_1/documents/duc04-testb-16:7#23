{"id": "duc04-testb-16:7#23", "contents": "Many Democrats, including Price and Mrs. Carson, are straddling a line that seems to shift with every new scandal-related disclosure. They do not want to appear close to a president whose conduct embarrasses them, yet they are wary of hopping on any impeachment bandwagon, sensing the possibility of a public backlash against Republicans. While publicly expressing confidence that the scandal will have little impact on them, their campaigns are preparing for the worst by placing greater emphasis than ever on behind-the-scenes efforts to prod their core constituencies to vote. The challengers in the Price and Carson districts, both political novices, have differing strategies, with one broadcasting a television commercial exploiting the scandal and the other taking a more subtle approach by highlighting the incumbent's voting record with Clinton."}
