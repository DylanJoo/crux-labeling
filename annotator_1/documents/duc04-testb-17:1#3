Addressing a crowd of supporters in Jerusalem, Netanyahu stated, \"We will build also in Har Homa as we will build in every part of Jerusalem.\" He also announced plans to construct homes at Har Homa by the year 2000. This move may be seen as provocative by the Palestinians, particularly in light of the recent suicide bombing at a Jerusalem market and the current sensitive political climate."}
