Relatives described him as an impressionable teenager who was influenced by Islamic militants during his time in Israeli prisons. He was jailed for a year at 15 for stoning Israeli cars and again at 17 for three-and-a-half years for similar offenses and affiliation with Islamic Holy War. After his release seven months ago, Sughayer seemed normal, working at his family's grocery store, finishing his high school classes, and planning to enroll in university."}
