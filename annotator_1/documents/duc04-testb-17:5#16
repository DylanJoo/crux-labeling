The Wye memorandum, which outlines the terms of the accord, states that the Palestinian Authority will inform the United States of the actions it has taken to outlaw organizations of a military, terrorist, or violent character. A joint Israeli-Palestinian meeting was held to discuss security in the wake of the attack, and the idea of outlawing Hamas and Islamic Jihad was brought up. The Palestinians propose banning activity by these groups that endangers Israelis or Palestinians, but cannot outlaw them outright as political movements."}
