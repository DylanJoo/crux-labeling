The radical group Islamic Jihad has claimed responsibility for the attack and vowed to carry out more to block the new peace accord. U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright has urged Netanyahu to ratify the new peace agreement within a few days, despite the recent bombing. Palestinian leaders have called on Israel not to use the bombing as an excuse to halt the peace process, emphasizing that the bombers came from Israeli-controlled areas and that Israel bears some responsibility for the security failure."}
