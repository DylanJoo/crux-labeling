The two bombers, Youssef Zughayer and Suleiman Tahayneh, were identified as members of Islamic Holy War from West Bank villages under Israeli security control. The Palestinian cabinet accused \"foreign forces\" of standing behind the attack, with one cabinet member pointing to Iran as a possible culprit. The cabinet promised to crack down on militants who are jeopardizing the recovery of Palestinian land and hopes for statehood by giving Israel a pretext to postpone carrying out the Wye accord."}
