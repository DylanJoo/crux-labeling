He made the announcement during the impeachment debate on President Clinton, and urged the president to follow his example and resign as well. The move stunned the House chamber, with many colleagues expressing shock and silence. Livingston stated, \"I must set the example that I hope President Clinton will follow,\" and his decision left the Republican Party in chaos just hours before the vote to impeach Clinton."}
