Tom DeLay is expected to fill the power vacuum at least temporarily, although it is unclear if he will take on the title of speaker. Many members of the party have rallied around Rep. Dennis Hastert of Illinois, who is well respected among his colleagues. Hastert had been promoted as a candidate for majority leader last month but never mounted a campaign. Rep. Dick Armey of Texas is expected to manage the reorganization, which Republican leaders have set for January 4."}
