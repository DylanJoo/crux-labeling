He had told Republican leaders earlier that day that Hustler magazine was going to expose his affairs early next year. Despite the momentous vote that was nearing on the floor, Livingston's wife, Bonnie, encouraged him to tell his colleagues immediately. In a closed-door meeting with his fellow Republicans, Livingston admitted to the affairs but made no offer to step down, receiving three standing ovations instead."}
