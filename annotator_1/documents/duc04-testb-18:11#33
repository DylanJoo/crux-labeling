{"id": "duc04-testb-18:11#33", "contents": "House Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde argued that the House of Representatives was obligated to impeach President Clinton, as the chief law-enforcement officer. He emphasized that the Senate could be innovative and creative in deciding the punishment, but the House was bound by the Constitution to move forward with the articles of impeachment. Hyde stressed that equal justice under the law was essential, and that the House was fighting for it. In contrast, Democrats read from the same Constitution and reached opposite conclusions, attacking the fairness of the proceedings. Representative Jerrold Nadler argued that the House was losing track of the distinction between sins and crimes, and that the president's actions did not constitute a great and dangerous offense to the republic."}
