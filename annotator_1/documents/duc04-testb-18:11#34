Representative David Bonior noted that U.S. troops were in battle just six days before Christmas, and a lame-duck Congress was rushing to overthrow the commander in chief. The debate was influenced by the ghosts of Watergate, with one Republican drawing parallels between the charges against Nixon 25 years ago and the counts against Clinton. Representative Lindsey Graham argued that Nixon had cheated the electoral system, and now the full House was voting to impeach Clinton for cheating the judicial system. However, most of the debate focused on Clinton's efforts to conceal his affair with Monica Lewinsky."}
