He emphasized that upholding the law was not a joyful task, but it was essential. Representative J.C. Watts added that the House had a responsibility to recognize lawlessness and demand honesty. However, Democrats assailed the premise of the impeachment case, with Representative John Conyers Jr. arguing that the four articles of impeachment were unfounded by evidence and failed to rise to the level of impeachment. He criticized the final count, abuse of power, as an attempt to dress up the perjury counts in Watergate language."}
