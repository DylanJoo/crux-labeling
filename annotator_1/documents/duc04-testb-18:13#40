{"id": "duc04-testb-18:13#40", "contents": "The Republicans' pursuit of the president has become an all-consuming obsession, fueled by their genuine hatred for him. They think he's a dishonest, immoral, issue-stealing, selfish child of the '60s. They don't think they're going to pay a political price for this, and if they do, they don't care. The House debate was not history. It was just a more hideous version of ``The McLaughlin Group.'' While Republicans tried to draw the distinction that Clinton had perjured himself, they ignored that the president had been lured by the Starr-Jones attorney team into testifying on Monica Lewinsky. The Republicans were so determined to do their high-tech lynching that they engaged in wacky role reversals."}
