The smart money argues that the Senate could not muster the 67 votes that would be needed to remove the wounded president from office, which would require the defection of 12 Democrats if all the Republicans stand against him. The smart money insists that someone will cut a deal to end all this. Maybe so. But the smarter money whispers, ``Remember.'' Remember that everyone in Washington, including Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., chairman of the Judiciary Committee, said the House would never, ever, treat impeachment as a partisan issue. Wrong. Remember that all the pundits predicted Democratic losses in the midterm elections, and when the opposite happened, they said impeachment was dead. Twice wrong. And remember that in the New Year the nation may travel down a road it has never traveled before."}
