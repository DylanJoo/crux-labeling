{"id": "duc04-testb-18:15#45", "contents": "President Clinton, known for his remarkable comebacks, has already begun to demonstrate his ability to conduct the nation's business despite the challenges he faces. Like Richard Nixon, who regained respectability after leaving office, Clinton aims to re-establish his authority while still in office. With two-thirds of the American public continuing to approve of his political leadership, Clinton has a significant advantage. He is pressing for a deal on censure, and has even sought the help of former Senator Bob Dole, whom he defeated in 1996, to act as an emissary to the Senate majority. The numbers suggest that a censure resolution is a plausible target, with 45 Democrats and six Republicans potentially supporting it."}
