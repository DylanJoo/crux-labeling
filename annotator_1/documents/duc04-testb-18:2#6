He emphasized that Congress has no business intruding into private acts, and that a distinction must be made between private acts of infidelity and public acts. Republicans, including Livingston himself, had made this same distinction between Clinton's sexual indiscretions and Livingston's, saying that Clinton lied about his private acts and therefore abused the legal system and his powers."}
