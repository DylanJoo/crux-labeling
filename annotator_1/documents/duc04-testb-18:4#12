David Bonior, Democrat of Michigan, urged his colleagues to focus on the issue at hand, but the hours leading up to the vote were marked by a series of dramatic and unexpected events. The resignation of Rep. Robert Livingston, who had been set to become House speaker, was announced during the debate, catching many by surprise. The news sent shockwaves through the Capitol and dominated the television coverage, with all the major networks and cable channels carrying the story. As the debate continued, the Republicans used Livingston's resignation to call for the president's resignation, while the Democrats countered that the president would stay in office and Livingston should reconsider his decision."}
