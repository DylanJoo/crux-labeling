The debate highlighted the vast differences between the parties on issues of relativism and absolute truth, with Rep. Tom DeLay, R-Texas, arguing that the impeachment was a debate about these fundamental values. Other members of Congress, including Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., and Rep. Dick Gephardt, the minority leader, spoke out against the \"sexual McCarthyism\" and \"politics of personal destruction\" that had become prominent in the crisis. However, with the impeachment vote and the latest developments in the Iraq crisis dominating the news, there was little time to focus on these deeper themes and messages."}
