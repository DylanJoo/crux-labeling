{"id": "duc04-testb-18:5#15", "contents": "Bob Livingston, the incoming speaker of the House, faced a challenging 24 hours as the debate on impeaching President Clinton unfolded. He was involved in a chaotic procedural wrangle over the terms of the debate and later disclosed to his Republican colleagues that he had had extramarital affairs during his 20-year tenure in Congress. This revelation came after an investigation by Larry Flynt, the publisher of Hustler magazine, who claimed to have learned about Livingston's affairs through his publication's investigation. Flynt had earlier offered $1 million to anyone who could prove they had had affairs with members of Congress, citing the \"hypocrisy\" of those investigating Clinton. He also mentioned that his publication would soon reveal indiscretions of several other Republicans."}
