{"id": "duc04-testb-18:5#16", "contents": "Livingston's disclosure was met with a mix of reactions from his colleagues. While some Democrats made oblique allusions to human failures during the debate, no one directly addressed Livingston's conduct or suggested that it would influence their votes on impeachment. Instead, many Republicans and Democrats seemed reluctant to discuss the matter. Rep. David Obey, D-Wis., praised Livingston as a \"first-rate human being\" and emphasized the importance of focusing on one's own actions rather than judging others. Conservative Republicans also appeared willing to overlook Livingston's disclosure, distinguishing it from Clinton's actions by noting that the president had \"trampled\" on the legal system."}
