Republicans drew distinctions between Livingston's revelations and the sex-and-mendacity scandal surrounding President Clinton, who is charged with perjury and abuse of power in an impeachment resolution. Livingston noted that his indiscretions were not with employees on his staff and that he had never been asked to testify under oath about them. He also stated that he had sought spiritual counseling and had received the forgiveness of his family."}
