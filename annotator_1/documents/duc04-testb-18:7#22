Despite the protests and demonstrations of ordinary Americans, the right-wing extremists in the House remained determined to remove the President from office. Rep. Thomas Barrett, a Democrat from Wisconsin, reminded his Republican colleagues that the Constitution did not allow for the removal of a President simply because they disagreed with him. However, his words fell on deaf ears. The Republicans' contempt for the voters was evident, with former Senator Alan Simpson dismissing the attention span of Americans as being focused on trivial matters like movies and stock reports."}
