{"id": "duc04-testb-18:7#23", "contents": "The impeachment crisis has exposed the Republican Party as being out of step with the majority of Americans. The party's extremism and partisan zealotry have been on full display, with even previously undecided Republicans surrendering their independence to follow the right-wing lead. The case of Rep. John McHugh, who voted for impeachment despite expressing reservations about a Senate conviction, is a prime example of this mass cowardice. The GOP's slogan, as embodied by Livingston's comment, \"Let us disregard the outside influences,\" has become a rallying cry for the party's extremists. However, this approach will ultimately prove costly, as the party will reap the bitter harvest of the unfair partisan seeds they have sown."}
