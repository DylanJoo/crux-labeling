Robert Livingston, nominated for speaker last month by his party, shocked the House by announcing he would not run for speaker and would resign from the House after 21 years of service. He urged Clinton to \"heal the wounds that you have created\" and resign, sparking angry boos and shouts from Democrats. Livingston apologized for his own extramarital affairs, revealed two days prior, and stated that he could not lead under current circumstances. Clinton's spokesman, Joe Lockhart, immediately rejected the advice, saying the president had no intention of resigning."}
