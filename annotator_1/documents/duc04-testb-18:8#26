{"id": "duc04-testb-18:8#26", "contents": "The impeachment process is expected to face significant hurdles in the Senate, where a two-thirds majority is required for conviction. With only 55 Republicans and 45 Democrats in the Senate, assembling the necessary 67 votes for conviction is unlikely. The Republican argument centers on Clinton's alleged lies about his affair with Monica Lewinsky, with Rep. Dick Armey stating that \"a nation of laws cannot be ruled by a person who breaks the law.\" The Senate could potentially halt a trial as part of a deal, but Sen. Trent Lott has insisted that no bargaining over censure can prevent the trial from starting."}
