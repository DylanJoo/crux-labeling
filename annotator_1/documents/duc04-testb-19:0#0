The module, called Zarya, or Sunrise, was lifted off from the Baikonur launchpad in Kazakstan into an initial orbit of 200 kilometers (125 miles) above Earth on Friday. To adjust its orbit, flight controllers fired one of the module's two maneuvering engines, resulting in a new orbit of about 230 kilometers (157 miles) in space. According to Russian Space Agency general director Yuri Koptev, the maneuver was carried out \"with great accuracy,\" and the 24-ton core module is cruising through space without any problems."}
