The Russian-built Zarya control module and the American-made Unity chamber were joined together, marking a historic moment in space exploration. The 240-mile-high construction job began with Nancy Currie's capture of Zarya using the shuttle robot arm, followed by the challenging task of stacking the two giant cylinders in the cargo bay. The two station pieces are massive, measuring 77 feet from tip to tip and weighing a combined 70,000 pounds, requiring the crew to rely on a computerized vision system and camera views rather than direct line of sight. This \"blind\" docking was a first for the space program."}
