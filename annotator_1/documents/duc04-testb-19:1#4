The union, intended to last the station's 15-year or more lifetime, set the stage for a spacewalk by two astronauts on Monday to attach electrical connectors and cables between the two components. The successful docking was a significant milestone in the assembly of the international space station, which will eventually have a mass of 1 million pounds, be longer than a football field, and house up to seven astronauts and cosmonauts."}
