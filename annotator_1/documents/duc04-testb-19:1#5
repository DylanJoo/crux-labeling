Before capturing Zarya, the astronauts had to steer clear of a piece of space junk that strayed too close, requiring them to fire the shuttle thrusters to put an extra three miles between Endeavour and the debris. Additionally, two antennas on Zarya were still undeployed, and a battery issue required the astronauts to take up a replacement part. Despite these issues, the crew successfully completed the docking and set the stage for the next phase of the mission, including three planned spacewalks to install handrails and other tools for future crews."}
