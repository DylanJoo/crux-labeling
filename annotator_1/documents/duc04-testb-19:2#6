The module, built in Russia with $240 million from the United States, is a crucial component of the station, which will eventually grow into the largest orbital laboratory in history. Zarya is to be joined in two weeks by the first American module, a docking hub called Unity, which will be carried by the space shuttle Endeavour. This is just the beginning of a complex assembly process that will involve 43 more flights by American and Russian rockets carrying over 100 parts to be assembled in space."}
