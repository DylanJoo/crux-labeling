Daniel Goldin, the administrator of NASA, expressed his excitement and caution about the project, noting that there are still 44 launches to go, about 1,000 hours of space walks, and countless problems to overcome. Despite these challenges, Goldin is confident that the international space station will become a reality, thanks to the trust and cooperation among the partner nations."}
