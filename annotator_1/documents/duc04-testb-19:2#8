Due to the collapse of the Russian economy, there are doubts about Russia's ability to support both the Mir and the new space station. While Russia has promised to abandon Mir and destroy it by next summer, recent reports suggest that there are efforts to extend its life. However, NASA has made it clear that any proposal to extend Mir's life must not impact the international space station, and that Russia must demonstrate its ability to support both projects."}
