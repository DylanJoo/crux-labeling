The international space station, the U.S.-led successor to Russia's beleaguered Mir, involves 16 nations and is due to be completed by 2004. It will consist of more than 100 elements that will take 45 assembly flights to complete. Russia's crucial participation has been hampered by the country's financial problems, but the launch of Zarya marks a significant step forward in the project."}
