The launch was met with cheers from Russian space officials and others as ground control announced that the capsule had separated from its booster rocket and reached its first orbit at about 200 kilometers (125 miles) above the Earth. The heads of the space agencies of 16 nations participating in the project watched the lift-off from a distance of about 5 kilometers (3 miles). Russian and U.S. officials said the launch was \"flawless\" and the module performed well during initial tests."}
