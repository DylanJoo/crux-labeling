The station is due to be completed by 2004 and will weigh 500 tons (over a million pounds). It is expected to cost at least $40 billion, with the US planning to pay $21 billion. The station will serve as an orbital home for visiting astronauts and cosmonauts for up to 20 years. Zarya is to fly alone for two weeks before a rendezvous with the American space shuttle Endeavor, which is to be launched on December 3 carrying the Unity connecting module."}
