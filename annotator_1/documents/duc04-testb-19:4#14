Russia has repeatedly failed to meet deadlines for constructing the crew module, putting the whole project behind schedule. The Russian space agency has sold its early research time on the station to NASA for $60 million to complete the segment. The project is crucial for the beleaguered Russian space industry, whose funding has collapsed since the Soviet collapse. The project would allow Russia to keep up to 80,000 jobs over the next 15 years."}
