Their primary objective was to attach two 100-pound antennas to Unity, the American-made side of the space station, which will provide a direct and uninterrupted communication link between Unity and NASA's Mission Control. They also planned to tackle a more challenging task, attempting to open a stuck antenna on Zarya, the Russian-built control module, if time permitted."}
