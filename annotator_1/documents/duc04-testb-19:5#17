The antenna was rolled up on a spool and engineers were concerned it might pop open with enough force to cause harm if Newman got too close. This was Ross's sixth spacewalk and Newman's third, with one more spacewalk planned for the 12-day mission. On Saturday, the astronauts will conduct a photo survey, remove a sack of tools, and Newman may try to unjam the other stuck Zarya antenna."}
