NASA estimates 43 more launches and 159 more spacewalks will be needed after this mission to assemble the entire orbiting complex. The 16-nation space station will have a mass of 1 million pounds, be longer than a football field, and house up to seven astronauts and cosmonauts. The successful docking of Zarya and Unity demonstrates the capabilities of the shuttle's robot arm and the precision of the astronauts, paving the way for future construction and assembly of the space station."}
