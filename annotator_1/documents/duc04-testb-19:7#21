A Russian Proton booster rocket carried the module into its initial orbit 200 kilometers (125 miles) above the Earth and the unit was operating as planned, officials said. This launch marked a significant milestone in the project, as it brought together the efforts of 16 nations working towards a common goal in space exploration."}
