{"id": "duc04-testb-19:9#27", "contents": "Endeavour and its astronauts closed in on Sunday to capture the first piece of the international space station, the Russian-made Zarya control module that had to be connected to the Unity chamber aboard the shuttle. Stacking the two giant cylinders 240 miles above the Earth was considered the most difficult part of the mission. The job fell to Nancy Currie, the shuttle crane operator who had deftly hoisted and repositioned Unity in the cargo bay on Saturday. The two station pieces are so big - 77 feet from the tip of one to the tip of the other with a combined mass of 70,000 pounds - that Currie and her crewmates were going to have to rely on a computerized vision system and camera views, rather than direct line of sight. Such a \"blind\" docking had never been attempted before."}
