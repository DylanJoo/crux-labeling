We have margin on everything,\" said flight director Bob Castle. Before beginning their final approach to Zarya - Russian for Sunrise - the shuttle's six astronauts had to steer clear of a chunk of a rocket launched last month from California. Mission Control ordered the pilots to fire the shuttle thrusters to put an extra three miles between Endeavour and the space junk, putting Endeavour a total of five miles from the orbiting debris."}
