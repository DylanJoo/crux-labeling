{"id": "duc04-testb-1:0#0", "contents": "The National Basketball Association (NBA) announced the cancellation of all 114 preseason games on Monday, citing stalled negotiations with the Players Association over a new collective bargaining agreement. This decision is expected to lead to the first work stoppage in NBA history. The cancellation of preseason games is a strong signal that the owners and players are willing to cancel at least part of the regular season to settle their labor dispute. Both sides agree that it would take at least three weeks to hold abbreviated training camps and sign over 200 free agents to new contracts."}
