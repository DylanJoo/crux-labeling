{"id": "duc04-testb-1:1#3", "contents": "The NBA lockout has been ongoing, with the main point of contention being the Larry Bird exception, a clause that allows teams to pay their own free agents whatever they want, regardless of salary-cap rules. The owners claim that this clause has led to exorbitant salaries for unproven stars and are determined to enforce a restricted salary cap, also known as a hard cap. This would put a ceiling on how much one player could earn. The owners argue that the current agreement, which was terminated last year, allowed players to receive more than their fair share of the $2 billion in income, with player salaries reaching 57.1 percent of total basketball-related income."}
