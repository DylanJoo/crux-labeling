The players' union leadership has rejected several new proposals, including one that would have resulted in an average player salary of more than $3.1 million and a minimum salary for 10-year veterans of $750,000. The players argue that they would have received much of this increase anyway if the current deal had been left in place. The dispute has resulted in the cancellation of the preseason, with the league estimating a loss of between $35 million and $40 million."}
