{"id": "duc04-testb-1:11#34", "contents": "The proposal also includes provisions that address the league's concerns about salary growth. If the 63-percent threshold is met, annual 20 percent raises for multi-year contracts would be reduced. Players would instead receive raises of 10 percent or the rate of growth in league revenues. The union believes this addresses the league's desire to bring salaries in line with revenues. Additionally, the proposal includes a right of first refusal on free agents after the fourth year for incoming rookies, which would give teams more control over player contracts. The players have also agreed to make marijuana a banned substance, although details of testing have not been negotiated."}
