The league has become known for its high salaries and selfish players, a far cry from the selfless era of Bird and Magic Johnson. The players' union is led by Patrick Ewing, who has been criticized for his handling of the situation. Bill Walton, a former teammate of Bird's, believes that the league has lost its way and that the emphasis on money and individualism has hurt the game. Bird himself has always been a businessman's ball player, but even he acknowledges that the current state of the league is not what he envisioned."}
