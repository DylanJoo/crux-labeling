He also discussed the possibility of a significantly shortened season, acknowledging that the league can't possibly sell a reduced number of games to its fans. Granik mentioned that the league is open to exploring different season lengths, such as 60, 50, or 49 games, but no decision has been made yet. The parties have a few months to come to an agreement before facing the decision of a shortened season."}
