{"id": "duc04-testb-1:3#9", "contents": "Substantive talks between the National Basketball Association's labor dispute opposing sides resumed after a two-month hiatus, but unfortunately, no settlement was reached. A five-hour meeting, described as cordial by the league and \"almost like two bulls letting off a little steam\" by the players association, resulted in another scheduled round of talks next Tuesday. However, with the current pace of negotiations, it's unlikely that a full season can be preserved, and the league may lose its first regular-season games to labor strife in November."}
