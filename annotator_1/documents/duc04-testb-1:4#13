This should not be a surprise. Sports is an entertainment business, not unlike movies. Big stars get millions, while most get union scale. Over the years, NBA efforts to stem the rise of salaries have failed. The most important loophole in its salary cap lets a team sign its own free agent for whatever it is willing to pay. When that was adopted, it was assumed that no team would pay a lot more than a rival could pay. But it has not worked out that way."}
