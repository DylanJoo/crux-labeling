{"id": "duc04-testb-1:5#15", "contents": "On Monday, arbitrator John Feerick is set to make a crucial ruling in a case that will significantly impact the North American National Basketball Association and its players' union. The decision will determine whether over 200 players with guaranteed contracts will receive payment during the ongoing lockout. If the players emerge victorious, the owners will be liable for approximately $800 million in guaranteed salaries, although they have indicated their intention to appeal if they lose. The league has already filed a lawsuit against the players, challenging Feerick's jurisdiction."}
