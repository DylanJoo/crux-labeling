According to union director Billy Hunter, a win for the players would \"embolden the spirit and resolve\" of the players, but would not necessarily bring an end to the lockout. Hunter notes that even if the players win, the owners have indicated their intention to appeal the decision, which could delay payment to the players. In contrast, if the owners win, it would remove the last remaining wild card that the players had been holding, and would likely lead to a prolonged lockout."}
