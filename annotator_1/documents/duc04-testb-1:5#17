{"id": "duc04-testb-1:5#17", "contents": "The case centers around the issue of guaranteed contracts and whether owners are liable for payment during a work stoppage. The union argues that owners should have included lockout language in player contracts to protect themselves from liability, citing a precedent set by the Sacramento Kings in 1994. The NBA, on the other hand, argues that labor law allows employers to withhold pay from employees during a lockout. The ruling will have significant financial implications, with most players due to receive their first paychecks on November 15. However, none of the players have received payment to date, and it remains uncertain when or if they will receive their guaranteed salaries."}
