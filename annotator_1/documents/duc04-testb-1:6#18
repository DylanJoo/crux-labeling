{"id": "duc04-testb-1:6#18", "contents": "Arbitrator John Feerick is set to rule on a critical issue affecting the North American National Basketball Association and the players' union. The decision, expected on Monday, will determine whether over 200 players with guaranteed contracts should receive payment during the ongoing lockout. If the players emerge victorious, the owners will be liable for approximately $800 million in guaranteed salaries, although an appeal is likely to follow. The league has already challenged Feerick's jurisdiction in a separate lawsuit."}
