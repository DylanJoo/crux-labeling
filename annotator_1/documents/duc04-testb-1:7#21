This marks the first time in the league's 51-year history that regular-season games will be lost. The decision was made after a nearly three-and-a-half-hour meeting at a Manhattan hotel, where the players association proposed a tax system instead of a hard salary cap. The owners stated they would respond to the proposal by Friday."}
