However, Fischer remained resolute in his stance, condemning China's sentencing of two dissidents on Monday. He deemed the reaction of Chinese courts as \"totally unacceptable\" and called for the immediate release of the dissidents. Fischer emphasized that the accused individuals had merely exercised their right to free speech and assembly through peaceful means, as guaranteed by China's constitution."}
