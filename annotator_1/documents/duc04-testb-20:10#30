{"id": "duc04-testb-20:10#30", "contents": "As a staunch idealist and Marxist, Xu Zhiyong chose to pursue his education through real-world experiences rather than enrolling in a university. This unconventional approach led him to serve in the navy for five years, followed by a stint as an electrician with the Beijing railroad. It was during this time that he became increasingly involved with the democracy movement, which ultimately led to his imprisonment. Xu's commitment to his ideals was evident in his interactions with his loved ones, particularly in the aftermath of his trial."}
