Fischer's statement came after China's courts handed down the verdicts on Monday. The German minister described the reaction of Chinese authorities as \"totally unacceptable.\" Fischer's criticism of China's actions was not without precedent, as he had recently drawn China's ire by meeting with exiled dissident Wei Jingsheng."}
