Critics argued that the tough prison terms were evidence of the failure of the administration's policy of encouraging trade and diplomatic ties with China in hopes of democratic reform. The dissidents, Xu Wenli, Wang Youcai, and Qin Yongming, were charged with subversion and received sentences ranging from 11 to 13 years in prison. The State Department condemned the sentences, calling for the immediate release of the dissidents."}
