He was imprisoned three times in the past 17 years, including a three-year spell in a labor camp in the remote northeast. Liu was never put on trial and was subjected to harsh treatment, including beatings and confinement, while in the labor camp. His wife, Chu Hailan, also faced harassment and detention while campaigning for his release. Liu's release has been welcomed by human rights groups, but they have also criticized the Chinese government's tactics, saying that forcing dissidents into exile is a form of human rights violation and persecution."}
