The move appears to be an attempt to deflect international criticism ahead of the upcoming trial of prominent dissident Xu Wenli. Xu is one of several leading members of a would-be opposition political party who have been put on trial for subversion in a recent crackdown. At least 32 dissidents have been arrested or interrogated in the past three weeks. Human rights groups have criticized the Chinese government's timing, calling it manipulative and cynical."}
