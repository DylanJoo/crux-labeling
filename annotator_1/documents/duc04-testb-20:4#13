The treaty guarantees freedoms of speech and assembly, but it would not come into force until ratified by the legislature, which may attach reservations that effectively nullify some provisions. British Prime Minister Tony Blair is set to visit Beijing, where he has vowed to discuss differences over human rights with Chinese leaders. Dissidents and an international press freedom group have urged Blair to persuade Chinese leaders to free political prisoners, including journalist Shi Binhai, businessman Fang Jue, and other imprisoned activists."}
