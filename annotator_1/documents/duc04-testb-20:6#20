Secretary-General Kofi Annan and U.N. human rights commissioner Mary Robinson, calling on China to stop persecuting political critics and release political prisoners. Additionally, 214 dissidents in China planned a 100-day series of rotating 24-hour fasts to protest the sentences, but the two activists who were to begin the fasts were detained by police. The British ambassador in Beijing, Tony Galsworthy, and others delivered a protest message to the Chinese government demanding the immediate release of Xu, Qin, and Wang."}
