Xu's trial is seen as a significant blow to the nascent opposition movement, which has been trying to use Chinese laws to register and establish itself. Xu's wife, He Xintong, has expressed concerns about the fairness of the trial, citing the fact that Xu's appointed lawyer has not even read the whole indictment. Authorities have also denied requests by Xu's colleagues to attend the trial, and He has been given only one pass to attend."}
