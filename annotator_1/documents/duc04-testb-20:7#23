The China Democracy Party has been trying to establish itself in 14 provinces and cities, but authorities have responded by detaining or questioning at least 32 members. The party's appeal is evident in a petition signed by 205 dissidents calling for the immediate release of Xu and two other leaders. Despite the government's attempts to present a more open and tolerant image, its actions suggest a continued crackdown on dissent and opposition."}
