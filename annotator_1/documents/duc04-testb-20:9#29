{"id": "duc04-testb-20:9#29", "contents": "Xu's lawyer argued that Xu had engaged in peaceful expression of his views and that this could not amount to subversive activities against the state. However, the court declared Xu guilty and sentenced him to a lengthy prison term. Xu, born in 1943 in Jiangxi province, was interested in politics from a young age. His wife described him as having been engaged in politics even as a teenager, and he was a key figure in the China Democracy Party. The harsh sentence has been widely condemned, with many seeing it as a clear example of the Chinese government's suppression of dissent and opposition to Communist Party rule."}
