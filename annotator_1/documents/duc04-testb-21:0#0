{"id": "duc04-testb-21:0#0", "contents": "Two yacht crew members are dead, three yachts remain missing, and rescue resources were stretched to the limit on Monday as huge seas and gale-force winds continued to batter the Sydney-to-Hobart race fleet. A helicopter rescue team flew to a spot about 50 nautical miles off the far south New South Wales town of Merimbula early Monday morning. Two crew found dead on the stricken 40-foot vessel Business Post Naiad were left behind while seven colleagues were winched aboard the helicopter and flown to Merimbula Hospital. The deaths were confirmed by an Australian Search and Rescue Coordination Center spokesman in Canberra a short time later. Neither organization was able to say how the sailors died or give details on the injuries suffered by surviving crewmen."}
