{"id": "duc04-testb-21:0#1", "contents": "Three yachts remain missing, and there was no sign of a sailor swept off the Sword of Orion when the boat rolled in wild seas on Sunday night. The missing boats are veteran cutter Winston Churchill, which sailed in the inaugural 1945 race, B-52, and Solo Globe Challenger. A major search involving Australia's navy continued Monday morning for those missing. Race spokesman Peter Campbell said it was not known how long the sailor washed overboard could survive in the water. \"It's supposition. We had John Quinn survive for 5 1-2 hours in 1993 and that was in the middle of the night in very severe conditions,\" Campbell said. Despite the horrendous conditions, it was unlikely the race would be called off, as it is the sole responsibility of the skipper of each yacht to decide whether he continues in the race or retires."}
