An AMSA spokesman said they were alerted that the 30-foot Sydney yacht Sword of Orion had rolled in heavy seas near Gabo Island about 450 kilometers (280 miles) east of Melbourne. Several crewmen were injured, including one with a broken leg. The yacht, which has a crew of 11, was halfway across Bass Strait when it overturned. A total of 37 yachts have been forced to retire from the 630-nautical-mile race, many having been dismasted or suffering injuries to crew. American maxi Sayonara was narrowly ahead of last year's line winner Brindabella, and although the two were forced to reduce sail and cut speed, they were still well inside the race record."}
