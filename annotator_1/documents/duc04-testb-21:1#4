Rescuers in more than 30 search aircraft were similarly unsure of the whereabouts and condition of Solo Globe and its crew. Seven others on board the Business Post Naiad were put aboard a helicopter and flown to Merimbula Hospital. The center was unable to identify the sailors, say how they died, or give details on the injuries sustained by surviving crewmen. There were unconfirmed reports that one of the dead sailors was British."}
