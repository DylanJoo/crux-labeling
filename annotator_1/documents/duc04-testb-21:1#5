Peter Campbell, a race spokesman, said it was not known how long the sailor washed overboard could survive in the water. A police helicopter rescued a yachtsman swept overboard when Kingurra rolled over, and 37 yachts had been forced out of the 1,160-kilometer (725-mile) race due to the severe weather. The Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) alerted all shipping in Bass Strait as high winds and huge seas smashed into the remnants of the 115-boat fleet."}
