{"id": "duc04-testb-21:2#6", "contents": "British sailor Glyn Charles was missing and presumed drowned, becoming the third fatality in the Sydney-to-Hobart yacht race, while three others remained missing in rough seas after nightfall Monday. Robin Poke, a spokesman for the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA), admitted it was unlikely the 33-year-old Charles could survive more than 24 hours at sea after being washed off Sword of Orion on Sunday night. Charles sailed in four Admiral's Cups and represented Britain in the Star Class at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, where he finished 11th. Two sailors died after gale-force winds and high seas battered the entrants."}
