{"id": "duc04-testb-21:4#14", "contents": "Larry Ellison believes unforeseen damage is the only major barrier to victory. ``She is a much more modern boat than Brindabella, if we don't break, we should beat Brindabella, we should beat anybody,'' Ellison said. The race is tipped to start Saturday under freshening north easters with the prospect of showers and a thunder storm before a southerly change of around 25-30 knots later in the day. The southerly is expected to ease to 15-20 knots over Sunday before swinging back to the north on Monday with a west to south westerly change expected to move through Tasmania and Bass Strait on Tuesday when the first yacht is anticipated to finish."}
