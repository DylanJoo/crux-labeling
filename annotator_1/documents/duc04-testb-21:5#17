{"id": "duc04-testb-21:5#17", "contents": "Despite the treacherous conditions, the race continued. With winds gusting to 90 mph (145 kph) and seas swelling to 35 feet (10 meters), a total of 37 yachts have been forced out of the 1,160-kilometer (725-mile) race. Many lost their masts or have injured crew. Race spokesman Peter Campbell said it was unlikely the race would be called off, citing the instructions that it is the sole responsibility of the skipper of each yacht to decide whether he continues in the race or retires."}
