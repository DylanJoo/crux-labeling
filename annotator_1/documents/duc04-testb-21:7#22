A police helicopter rescued a yachtsman swept overboard when the Victorian yacht Kingurra was rolled over in huge seas 19 nautical miles south of Gabo Island. John Campbell, an American, was in the water for about 40 minutes and was suffering from hypothermia when he was winched to safety by senior constable Barry Barclay, who dropped into 20-foot seas to secure Campbell. The Victorian state police Air Wing used an infra-red night vision system to find Campbell and the Navy Sea King is using the same equipment to try to find the man lost from Sword of Orion."}
