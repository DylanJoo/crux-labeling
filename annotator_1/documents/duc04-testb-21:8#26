The American maxi Sayonara was narrowly ahead of last year's winner, Brindabella, although both were forced to reduce sail and cut speed due to the high winds and huge seas. The Australian Maritime Safety Authority alerted all shipping in Bass Strait, and at least 37 yachts had been forced out of the race. A rescue operation was also underway, with American John Campbell being rescued by a police helicopter after being swept overboard when Kingurra rolled over 35 kilometers (22 miles) south of Gabo Island."}
