The Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) has alerted all shipping in Bass Strait as high winds and huge seas smash into the remnants of the 115-boat fleet. A total of 37 yachts have been forced to retire from the 630-nautical-mile race, many having been dismasted or suffering injuries to crew. American maxi Sayonara was narrowly ahead of last year's line winner Brindabella, with both still well inside the race record."}
