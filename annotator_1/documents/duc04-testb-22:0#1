Mucic was sentenced to seven years in prison, with the conviction marking the first by an international court on the basis of so-called \"command responsibility\" since post-World War II tribunals convicted Nazi and Japanese superiors for the crimes of their subordinates. Hazim Delic, a Muslim who served as Mucic's deputy, was found guilty of two murders, rape, and torture, and was sentenced to 20 years."}
