Delalic, a Muslim, was cleared of charges of war crimes committed in 1992 against Serb prisoners in the Muslim-led Bosnian Army prison camp Celebici near his hometown of Konjic. Three others involved in the same case were convicted and will serve prison terms at The Hague for crimes committed as camp guards."}
