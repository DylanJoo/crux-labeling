The fighting, sometimes house to house, even room to room, took an unusually heavy toll among the Serbs, said Maloku, a former officer in the Yugoslav army. He said he believed that it was those deaths the Serbs avenged with the massacre of the Delijajs. In other major attacks during the conflict, the guerrillas generally found an escape hatch."}
