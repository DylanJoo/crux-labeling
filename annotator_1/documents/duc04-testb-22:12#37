When the firing had died down on Monday morning, he returned to the compound and ran into Imer, still wearing his guerrilla uniform. They went to one of the houses and found Imer Delijaj's brother, Adem, 33, shot dead, his body sprawled on the ground in the rain, and the burned torso of Fazli. Bashkim Delijaj described the scene, saying he looked in the window of their house and saw only the bones of his father."}
