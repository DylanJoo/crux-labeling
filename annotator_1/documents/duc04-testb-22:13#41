{"id": "duc04-testb-22:13#41", "contents": "A wake has been held at the burned Delijaj compound, following Albanian tradition, which will last several weeks. Color photographs of the youngest members of the family, and of Imer's mother and grandmother, have been mounted behind glass on a table outside the gate. Imer Delijaj, who has been acting as the host of the wake, has been tense and sparing with his words as he described his family's death. His lawyer, Bajram Krasniqi, believes that Imer Delijaj feels guilty for a faulty decision that led to the family's death. The case may be examined by the Hague tribunal, but it remains unclear whether they will closely investigate the massacre."}
