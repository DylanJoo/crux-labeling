{"id": "duc04-testb-22:15#46", "contents": "The tribunal convicted camp warden Zdravko Mucic, a Croat, of 11 war crimes and grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions due to his oversight of guards who murdered nine Serbs and tortured six. Mucic was sentenced to seven years in prison, which Tribunal Deputy Prosecutor Graham Blewitt of Australia considered inadequate and is contemplating appealing. Mucic's conviction marked the first time an international court had convicted someone based on \"command responsibility\" since post-World War II tribunals. Presiding Judge Adolphus Karibi-Whyte of Nigeria emphasized that Mucic was derelict in his duty and allowed heinous offenses to occur without taking disciplinary action."}
