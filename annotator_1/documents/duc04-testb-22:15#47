Inmates were subjected to beatings, rape, and other forms of torture, with at least 14 prisoners killed in 1992. The court also convicted Hazim Delic, a Muslim who served as deputy warden, of two murders, rape, and torture, sentencing him to 20 years. Esad Landzo, a Muslim guard, was convicted of killing three prisoners and torturing others, receiving a 15-year sentence. Both Delic and Landzo's defense attorneys announced their intention to appeal the convictions."}
