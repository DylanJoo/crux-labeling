Ivo Daalder, a former Bosnia expert on the National Security Council, praised the coordination between the Tribunal and NATO troops that led to Krstic's rapid arrest. The Srebrenica massacre, in which thousands of Muslim men were killed, was a key moment in the Bosnian conflict. It led to a shift in Western policy, with NATO ultimately agreeing to defend safe areas with air strikes. The arrest of Krstic is seen as a positive step towards holding those responsible for war crimes accountable."}
