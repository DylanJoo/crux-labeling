However, they are often accompanied by armed guards, and NATO forces have never attempted to apprehend them, reportedly fearing casualties and a backlash from Bosnian Serbs. Both men are believed to have left the Bosnian Serb Republic to live in Serbia, which is part of Yugoslavia and controlled by Slobodan Milosevic. Meanwhile, General Radislav Krstic, who was recently transferred to The Hague for trial, is the 35th suspect to be taken into custody and the 26th person currently being held there."}
