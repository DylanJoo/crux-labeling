The tribunal was established in 1993 to investigate alleged atrocities during the wars in Croatia and Bosnia. The meeting, organized by the Humanitarian Law Center, marked the first international debate on the topic in Yugoslavia. Despite some objections, the Yugoslav authorities allowed the two-day discussions to take place without any issues. However, state-run media largely ignored the event. The participants generally agreed that crimes against humanity must be punished, and that the tribunal's work is crucial in achieving this goal."}
