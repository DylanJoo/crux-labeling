He was given a list of Muslim targets and ordered to kill as many as possible. Jelisic seemed to relish the task, and witness testimony will establish that he was an \"efficient and enthusiastic participant in the genocide.\" The U.N. court has convicted several individuals of war crimes, but this trial marks its first attempt to secure a genocide conviction. An earlier genocide trial was halted due to the defendant's death in his tribunal cell."}
