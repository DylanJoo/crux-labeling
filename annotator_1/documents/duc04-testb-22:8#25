The trial also will give survivors of his ruthless campaign a chance to tell their story in court. To convict Jelisic of genocide, prosecutors must prove that the murders _ most of them carried out with close-range shots from an automatic pistol _ were part of a campaign intended to wipe out an entire ethnic group in the northern Bosnian town of Brcko. Jelisic, who was arrested in January by U.S. troops serving in the NATO force in Bosnia, has pleaded guilty to a total of 31 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity."}
