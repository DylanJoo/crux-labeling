Delalic was cleared of responsibility for war crimes committed against Serb captives at a Bosnian government-run prison camp under his command. However, Prosecutor Grant Niemann said he would appeal Delalic's acquittal, and asked judges to keep him in custody pending the outcome of the appeal. The U.N. court convicted camp commander Zdravko Mucic, a Croat, of 11 war crimes and grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions because he oversaw guards who murdered nine Serbs and tortured six. Mucic was sentenced to seven years in prison."}
