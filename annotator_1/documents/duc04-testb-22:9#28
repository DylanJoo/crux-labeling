{"id": "duc04-testb-22:9#28", "contents": "The conviction of Mucic was the first by an international court on the basis of so-called ``command responsibility'' since post-World War II tribunals convicted Nazi and Japanese superiors for the crimes of their subordinates. According to presiding Judge Adolphus Karibi-Whyte, Mucic was clearly derelict in his duty and allowed those under his authority to commit the most heinous of offenses, without taking any disciplinary action. Hazim Delic, a Muslim who served as Mucic's deputy, was found guilty of two murders and of raping two women as well as torturing other inmates. He was sentenced to 20 years. Esad Landzo, a Muslim guard, was convicted of three murders and the torture of at least three other inmates. He was jailed for 15 years."}
