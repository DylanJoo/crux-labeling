{"id": "duc04-testb-23:0#2", "contents": "Cardoso is preparing an emergency program of budget cuts to restore investor confidence and prevent a devaluation of the country's currency. Investors want Cardoso to outline the plans this week but he is expected to wait until after Sunday's second round of elections for state governors, whose support he needs for his budget cuts. The joint statement said the Brazil-IMF discussions ``were aimed at preparing the ground for prompt support by the international community, including the IMF, for the multi-year fiscal program to be announced soon by the Brazilian authorities, which will include new policy initiatives.'' The statement reiterated Brazil's goal of achieving a primary budget surplus of 2.6 percent of its gross domestic product in 1999, 2.8 percent in 2000 and 3.0 percent in 2001 which would '' fulfill the government target of stabilizing the ratio of net consolidated public sector debt to GDP by the year 2000.''"}
