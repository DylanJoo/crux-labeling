As part of this initiative, he has begun by cutting perks for the over 2,000 workers at the presidential palace in Brasilia. The measures include eliminating the afternoon courtesy snack, closing three barber shops, restricting the use of cellular phones and copiers, and increasing the price of the buffet offered to employees. These changes are expected to save nearly $145,000 per month. Cardoso has also promised to reduce his own travel expenses and has already taken a smaller delegation on a recent trip to Portugal."}
