This has led to a decline in investor confidence and a strong outflow of capital, resulting in a significant decrease in the country's foreign reserves. The high interest rates, which have been hiked to 50 percent a year, have also made it difficult for factories to access credit, leading to a recession and high unemployment rates. Union leaders have criticized the government's economic policies, saying that they have brought recession and unemployment, and that the proposed product-for-cash swap is a clear sign of the desperation felt by the business sector."}
