At the time, Clinton argued that the monetary fund should \"provide contingent finance to help countries ward off global financial contagion\" rather than wait for disaster to strike. Germany and Japan, though, have been reluctant to take part, one U.S. official noted, suggesting that Latin America is chiefly Washington's problem, not their own. U.S. officials working behind the scenes to organize the aid package have said nothing in public about the details of plans for a direct contribution to Brazil."}
