Despite Congress's initial objections to the $20 billion committed to Mexico, the actual amount used was $12 billion, which has since been paid back with interest. Administration officials believe that there would be few objections in Congress to direct U.S. participation in a Brazil bailout, as many lawmakers are now more concerned about the potential consequences of inaction. By acting soon to stabilize Latin America, the administration hopes to capitalize on the relative calm that has followed the late-summer panic."}
