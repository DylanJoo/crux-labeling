Rubin has been cautious in using this fund since the backlash following the 1995 Mexican bailout, and has only committed $3 billion in emergency aid programs for Indonesia and South Korea, without ultimately dispersing the funds. The US offered no direct help in the Russian bailout, which led to a panicked exit by investors from emerging markets and worsened Brazil's economic troubles."}
