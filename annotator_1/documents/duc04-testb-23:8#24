{"id": "duc04-testb-23:8#24", "contents": "The Commerce Department reported on Tuesday that the nation's trade deficit widened by $2.2 billion in August to $16.77 billion, the widest gap since 1992. This resulted from a decline in American exports and a sharp increase in imports from abroad. The trade deficit is running roughly 50 percent above last year's levels, with a projected $170 billion for the year, and is expected to widen further. Internal projections suggest that the trade deficit in 1999 could reach $300 billion, which could cut into growth and become a major political problem. Trade deficits carry both good and troubling signals about the economy, with the current flood of imports helping contain inflation and potentially providing an end-of-the-year boost for American exporters due to the weakening of the dollar on world markets."}
