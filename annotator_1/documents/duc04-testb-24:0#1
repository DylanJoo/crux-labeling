The Vatican newspaper L'Osservatore Romano attacked the Swedish Academy's choice, describing Saramago as an \"old-school communist\" with a \"substantially antireligious vision.\" Saramago's atheistic outlook and controversial opinions have frequently clashed with the establishment and the general public. His 1991 novel \"O Evangelho Segundo Jesus Cristo\" (The Gospel according to Jesus Christ) offended Portugal's Roman Catholic religious convictions and divided the country. Despite this, Saramago remains a prominent nonconformist through his regular newspaper and radio commentaries, inspired by his deep concern for his fellow man."}
