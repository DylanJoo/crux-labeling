The prize that year was shared by Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin for signing the Camp David peace accords, which Carter had brokered. The five-member Norwegian awards committee had wanted to honor Carter as well, but their own rules foiled them. According to Geir Lundestad, the current committee's nonvoting secretary, \"The Nobel committee wanted to give the prize to all three,\" but Carter had not been nominated by the deadline."}
