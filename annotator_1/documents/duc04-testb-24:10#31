{"id": "duc04-testb-24:10#31", "contents": "Saramago's writing style is characterized by his exuberant imagination and playfulness, making him one of Portugal's most popular contemporary novelists. In his recent work, \"Blindness,\" a nameless man in a nameless country suddenly goes blind, and the affliction quickly spreads, leading to a grim tale of social collapse. The Swedish Academy praised Saramago's \"idiosyncratic development of his own resonant style of fiction,\" which gives him a high standing in the literary world. He is the fourth consecutive European to win the prize and the first laureate to write in Portuguese."}
