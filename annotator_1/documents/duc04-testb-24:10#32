{"id": "duc04-testb-24:10#32", "contents": "The Nobel Literature Prize is one of five established by Alfred Nobel, and it recognizes writing that works \"in an ideal direction.\" The prize has been awarded since 1901, and it has been given to writers with diverse world-views, from the bleak futility of Samuel Beckett's works to the vivid epics of Iceland's Halldor Laxness. Saramago's win follows last year's prize to Italian playwright Dario Fo and the 1996 prize to Polish poet Wislawa Szymborska. The Nobel Prize announcements will continue with the Medicine winner on October 12, followed by the physics and chemistry winners on October 13, and the peace prize on October 16."}
