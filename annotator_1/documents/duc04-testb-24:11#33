He is the first Portuguese-language writer and one of the first card-carrying Communists to become a Nobel Literature laureate. The Swedish Academy praised Saramago for his parables sustained by imagination, compassion, and irony, which enable readers to apprehend an elusive reality. Saramago's novels often use the supernatural, allegorical, paradoxical, and irrational to address complex questions of faith and existence."}
