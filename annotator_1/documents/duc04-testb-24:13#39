{"id": "duc04-testb-24:13#39", "contents": "Jose Saramago's writing style is characterized by its unconventional punctuation and conflicting use of tenses, which reflects his sense of literary freedom. This is evident in his novel \"The Stone Raft,\" where he imagines the Iberian peninsula breaking free from Europe and drifting towards the New World. The book's bitter satire, \"The Gospel According to Jesus Christ,\" was also met with controversy, as it portrays God as using Jesus to create a religion that has spawned violence and intolerance. The book was vetoed by the Portuguese government as blasphemous, leading Saramago to leave his apartment in Lisbon for the solitude of Lanzarote."}
