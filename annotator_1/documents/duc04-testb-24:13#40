{"id": "duc04-testb-24:13#40", "contents": "Saramago's whimsical tale, \"The History of the Siege of Lisbon,\" was published in the United States last year. The story revolves around a humble proofreader who inserts the word \"not\" into a key passage in a standard history of Portugal, derailing the national saga. This \"lunatic creative act\" was praised by Edmund White in The New York Times Book Review, who noted that Saramago is overdue for a Nobel Prize. White's prediction was correct, as Saramago will receive his Nobel Prize this year. With the recent publication of \"Blindness\" in the United States, only his latest novel, \"Todos os Nomes,\" awaits translation into English."}
