He acknowledged that other Portuguese writers, such as Fernando Pessoa, would also have been worthy recipients. Saramago, the first Portuguese-language author to receive the prestigious award, expressed his delight at winning but emphasized that there were many others who could have been recognized. He joked about how he received the news from a German air hostess at Frankfurt airport, which led him to return to the city's book fair to meet the press and public."}
