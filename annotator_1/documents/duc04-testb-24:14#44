{"id": "duc04-testb-24:14#44", "contents": "Saramago's life journey is a remarkable one, from being born into a poor, illiterate family to becoming a Nobel laureate. He never finished university but continued to study part-time while working as a metalworker. His first novel, \"Terra do Pecado,\" was published in 1947, but he didn't return to fiction until after the fall of Antonio Salazar's regime in 1974. Since the 1980s, Saramago's works have been translated into over 20 languages, cementing his place as a prominent literary figure. Despite his success, Saramago remains humble, saying that nothing in his life would have led him to think he'd win the Nobel Prize."}
