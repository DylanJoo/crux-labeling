{"id": "duc04-testb-24:4#12", "contents": "On May 5, 1978, a series of planned experiments on arteries from a rabbit went awry when a technician failed to follow directions correctly. The technician performed one step of the experiment before instead of after he was supposed to wash out a drug used in an earlier phase of the experiment. Furchgott expected that the arteries would contract, but instead, they relaxed. This unexpected reaction sparked further investigation, and Furchgott used the insight to plan additional experiments. The technician's mistake ultimately led to a significant discovery."}
