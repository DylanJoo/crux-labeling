Rall also trained another Nobel Prize winner, Dr. Alfred Gilman, and worked with Dr. Earl Sutherland, who also won a Nobel Prize. Murad's early research focused on cyclic guanosine monophosphate, which later turned out to be critical in the nitric oxide story. Despite initial skepticism from the scientific community, Murad's work eventually contributed to the understanding of nitric oxide's many roles in the body. Interestingly, the Nobel Prizes were created by Alfred Nobel, whose invention of dynamite involved the use of nitroglycerine, and the award committee noted the irony that Nobel refused to take the nitroglycerine his doctor prescribed for his heart disease."}
