When asked that question, Swedish Academy permanent secretary Sture Allen smiled and said ``Look at the list of prizewinners!'' However, the answer obscures as much as it clarifies. On one hand, the Nobel Prize has recognized world-renowned writers such as Isaac Bashevis Singer and brought little-known wonders to light, such as Wislawa Szymborska. But the prize arguably also has honored the mediocre, heaping attention on those who would have been more fairly served by obscurity."}
