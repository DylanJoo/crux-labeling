The winner, or winners, will be announced on Thursday, although the Academy keeps its deliberations secret. The prize, awarded since 1901, shines a light on wonderful writers who may not be well-known, but are deserving of recognition. Editor of Granta literary magazine, Ian Jack, notes that while some winners may be obscure, the Nobel also highlights authors who are truly deserving, such as Trinidad-born V.S. Naipaul. However, Jack doubts Naipaul will win due to his dark and pessimistic portrayals of post-colonial African culture."}
