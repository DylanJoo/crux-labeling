{"id": "duc04-testb-24:7#22", "contents": "The Nobel Literature Prize has a prestigious history, but not all winners are considered equally deserving. Harold Bloom, a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters, criticizes the award committee's record of selections, saying they are often \"nationally 'correct' and politically 'correct.'\" Bloom argues that the list of winners includes \"fifth-raters\" and notable omissions, such as James Joyce and Marcel Proust. In contrast, Bloom's U.S. favorites include Cormac McCarthy, Philip Roth, and John Ashbery. A review of recent winners may provide clues about this year's laureate, with seven of the past 10 being men, two of the past three being poets, and four of the past 10 writing in English."}
