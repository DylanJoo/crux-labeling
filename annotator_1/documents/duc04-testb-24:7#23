Abe Harumasa, editor-in-chief of the Japanese literary magazine Bungei, favors Bei Dao, a Chinese poet associated with the democracy movement. Minoru Takeuchi, a professor of Chinese literature, suggests novelists Pa Kin and Xie Bing Xin as worthy candidates. Spain's Nobel hopes are pinned on Francisco Ayala, while Peru-born Mario Vargas Llosa and Portugal's Jose Saramago are also considered contenders. Saramago, however, is weary of speculation and prefers to focus on his writing."}
