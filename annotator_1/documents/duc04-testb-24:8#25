According to the Karolinska Institute, the citation for the prize noted that it was a \"sensation\" that a simple, common air pollutant like nitric oxide could have such important functions in the organism. The research has shown that nitric oxide acts as a signal molecule in the nervous system, as a weapon against infections, and as a regulator of blood pressure. This new understanding has sparked research into a wide range of new drugs, including those for heart problems, artherosclerosis, shock, and impotence."}
