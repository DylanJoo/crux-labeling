Prusiner of the University of California at San Francisco for his discovery of prions, the rogue proteins causing Mad Cow Disease. While the winners are often not well-known outside the medical community, the list of laureates includes notable names such as Ivan Pavlov, Robert Koch, and Francis Crick and James Watson. The medicine prize was the second of the six Nobels to be announced this year, with the physics and chemistry prizes to be announced on Tuesday, the economics prize on Wednesday, and the peace prize on Friday."}
