{"id": "duc04-testb-25:0#1", "contents": "The rebels, composed of ethnic Tutsis, disenchanted members of President Laurent Kabila's army, and opposition politicians, took up arms on August 2, accusing Kabila of mismanagement, corruption, and creating division among Congo's 400 tribes. The rebels have targeted Kindu since late August, when they were forced to retreat from the outskirts of the capital, Kinshasa, after troops from Angola and Zimbabwe came to Kabila's aid. Troops moving south from Kisangani, the largest city under rebel control, and moving west, had made steady gains against Kindu, which the government apparently used to build up force for a planned counter-offensive."}
