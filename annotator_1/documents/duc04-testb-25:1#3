It was impossible to say who had the upper hand in the battle for Kindu and its air base, which government forces have been using to launch airstrikes on eastern towns and to assemble ground troops. Rebel commander Richard Mondo said shelling and ground attacks, which began Monday, continued on Wednesday. Mondo said he was expecting air shipments of munitions to bolster the rebel offensive."}
