Sweaty and weary, some limping and others bandaged, they waited to be airlifted to a hospital in Goma, the rebel stronghold 380 kilometers (235 miles) east, on the Rwandan border. The rebels _ a coalition of ethnic Tutsis, disenchanted soldiers in Kabila's army and opposition politicians _ faced stiff resistance. In Kinshasa, the Ministry of Defense said Tuesday that the Congolese Armed Forces, known as the FAC, had killed 18 rebels in warding off the attacks."}
