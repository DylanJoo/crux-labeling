{"id": "duc04-testb-25:1#5", "contents": "Rebel leaders hope the capture of Kindu will boost morale and demonstrate can carry their two-month rebellion into the rest of Congo, Africa's third-largest nation. The rebel victory would also open routes to Katanga and Eastern Kasai provinces, rich in copper and diamonds. The rebels targeted Kindu since late August, when they were forced to retreat their march from extreme western Congo to the outskirts of Kinshasa after Angola and Zimbabwe sent troops to bail out Kabila. Rebel commanders say their 2,000 fighters face an estimated 5,000 government troops, apparently reinforced by Sudanese soldiers. Sudan denies involvement in Congo. The rebels accuse Kabila of betraying the eight-month rebellion that brought him to power in May 1997 through mismanagement and creating divisions among Congo's 400 tribes."}
