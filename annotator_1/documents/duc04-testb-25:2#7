{"id": "duc04-testb-25:2#7", "contents": "The current conflict, which began on August 2, has pitted the government-held west and south against the rebel-controlled east, with no political settlement in sight. Goma, a small trading post at the head of Lake Kivu, has become a hub for rebel leaders, soldiers, and displaced people. The rebels have promised to revitalize the economy by reducing taxes and paying civil servants, who have not received a paycheck in months or years. However, the war has also increased tribal animosity, particularly towards ethnic Tutsis, a tiny but highly successful minority in the eastern region."}
