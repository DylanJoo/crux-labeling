The influx of nearly 1 million Rwandan refugees in 1994 further exacerbated the situation, bringing anti-Tutsi ideology and fuelling the persecution of Tutsi landowners and ranchers. The subsequent rebellion backed by Rwanda and Uganda led to the ousting of dictator Mobutu Sese Seko in 1997, but the region has continued to experience instability, with many blaming politicians and foreign powers for meddling in their affairs."}
