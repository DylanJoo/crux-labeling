Rebel leader Ernest Wamba dia Wamba stated that they need to explain their cause to a global audience, as the Kabila government has been using the Internet to share their side of the story. The rebels, a coalition of ethnic Tutsis, disenchanted members of Kabila's army, and political opponents, accuse Kabila of power-grabbing, mismanagement, corruption, and sowing dissent among Congo's 400 tribes. A web site, www.prairienet.org/panafrican/cdm, has been set up by supporters in the United States to promote the rebellion."}
