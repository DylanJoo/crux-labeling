{"id": "duc04-testb-25:5#15", "contents": "Congolese rebels and their Rwandan allies launched a bold attack on Sunday, pushing through government defense lines in the strategic air base in Kindu, 32 kilometers northeast of the Elila River bridge. The rebels fired a barrage of artillery into government-held quarters and the air base, leading to a significant decrease in fighting. Rebel commander Fino Kabangu Kalunga reported that government forces, surrounded by 3,500 rebel troops from three directions, failed to respond to the attacks, with some troops retreating through a single road corridor. The rebels claimed to have shot down a Congolese Boeing 727 on Saturday, which was attempting to land at Kindu air base with 40 troops and ammunition. However, the private Congolese Airlines disputed this claim, stating that the victims were civilians fleeing fighting in Kindu."}
