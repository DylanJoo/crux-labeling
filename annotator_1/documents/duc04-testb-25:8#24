The fighting in the town of Kindu subsided after the rebels launched an artillery barrage into government-held buildings and the airfield, two miles (three kilometers) away. The rebels had shot down a Congolese Boeing 727 over the Kindu airport on Saturday, with no survivors reported. The rebels claimed the airplane was carrying 40 troops and ammunition, while the private Congolese Airlines said the victims were civilians fleeing fighting in Kindu."}
