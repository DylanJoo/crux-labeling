{"id": "duc04-testb-25:8#26", "contents": "The conflict in Congo has drawn in many of its neighbors, with unconfirmed reports of troops from Chad and the Sudan involved in defending Kindu. President Kabila accuses Rwanda and Uganda, former allies who installed him in power in May 1997, of sponsoring the rebels. Both countries claim they have legitimate security interests in eastern Congo and accuse Kabila of failing to rid the common border area of Rwandan and Ugandan rebels. The conflict began more than two months ago, with the rebels initially pushing far into the west, to the outskirts of Congo's capital, before being driven back to their bases in eastern Congo by Angola, Zimbabwe, and Namibia."}
