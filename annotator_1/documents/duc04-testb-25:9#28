Advance units had crossed the Lualaba River and were meeting stiff resistance in the town. Since the assault began, at least 18 enemy soldiers were killed, and 40 taken prisoner. The rebels also took casualties, but the number was not known. Mondo stated that the large Kindu air base was deserted and no one appeared to be in control."}
