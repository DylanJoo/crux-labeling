They have been using Kalima as a supply base, providing troops with rice, cooking oil, drinking water, and ammunition. A small airstrip near Kalima is being used by the rebels' Russian-built transport aircraft. The rebels have targeted Kindu since late August, after being forced to retreat from the outskirts of Kinshasa."}
