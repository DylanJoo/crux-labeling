{"id": "duc04-testb-26:0#0", "contents": "A panel investigating apartheid-era atrocities announced that it will not implicate the last apartheid president, F.W. de Klerk, in human rights abuses after he threatened a court challenge. The Truth and Reconciliation Commission had planned to release its long-awaited final report, but de Klerk objected to a finding that he was \"an accessory after the fact\" to bombings in the 1980s of the headquarters of a church group and of a labor federation. Former Archbishop Desmond Tutu, the truth panel's chairman, stated that the commission needed time to prepare to fight the legal challenge and would \"excise\" de Klerk's name from the report to avoid delaying its release."}
