The report will provide a detailed summary of South Africa's human rights history from 1960 to 1994, parceling out moral condemnations and recommending individual prosecutions. However, the report has been marred by controversy, with the African National Congress rejecting a finding that it too was guilty of human rights violations in its armed struggle. Additionally, other threatened legal challenges have led to fewer individuals being named as rights violators than planned."}
