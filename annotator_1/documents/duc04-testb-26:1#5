Madikizela-Mandela, who has not sought amnesty, was found accountable for human rights violations committed by her bodyguards, who killed and tortured suspected opponents. She was previously convicted in 1991 of kidnapping and being an accessory to an assault on four young men. The Truth and Reconciliation Commission has the ability to grant amnesty to those who admit their misdeeds and are found to have acted with political motives, but those who have not sought amnesty should be prosecuted, according to the report."}
