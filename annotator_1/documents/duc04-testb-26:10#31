{"id": "duc04-testb-26:10#31", "contents": "The bombings in question were a series of attacks carried out by the apartheid regime against its perceived enemies. These attacks were part of a broader campaign of violence and intimidation aimed at suppressing opposition to the regime. The fact that Vlok and Van der Merwe were involved in these bombings is a serious indictment of their actions during this period. De Klerk's decision not to report the matter raises questions about his own complicity in these events."}
