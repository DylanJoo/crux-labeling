It was designed to provide a mechanism for individuals to come forward and confess their crimes, in exchange for immunity from prosecution. The process was intended to promote healing and reconciliation, but it has also been criticized for allowing perpetrators to avoid accountability for their actions. In the case of Vlok and Van der Merwe, their application for amnesty highlights the complexities and challenges of this process."}
