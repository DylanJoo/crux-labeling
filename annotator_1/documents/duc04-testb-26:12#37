{"id": "duc04-testb-26:12#37", "contents": "One major flaw in the report is the absence of a section accusing F.W. de Klerk, the last apartheid president, of knowing about several bombings after the fact and keeping silent. It was excised because de Klerk is suing the commission. The ANC also sued, unsuccessfully, to stop publication. The lawsuits are a disappointing sign that South Africa's political parties are not interested in an honest look at their past, nor in the free flow of information. The controversy has added to widespread complaints that the commission has not helped the process of reconciliation. This is wrong. True reconciliation _ which occurs when a society is no longer paralyzed by the past and people can work and live together _ cannot be based on silence."}
