The hearings themselves, which allowed victims of human rights violations to tell their stories in public, helped the country heal and opened the eyes of many whites to the unpleasant truth about apartheid. The amnesty process, while permitting many important criminals to escape justice, is allowing families to know exactly what happened to their loved ones in dozens of cases that would likely have never gone to trial in South Africa's fragile judicial system. The process of helping the victims with scholarships and other necessary aid goes on, although it will not be enough. No commission can transform a society as twisted as South Africa's was. But the Truth Commission is the best effort the world has seen, and South Africa is the better for it."}
