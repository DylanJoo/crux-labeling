{"id": "duc04-testb-26:13#39", "contents": "President Nelson Mandela acknowledged on Saturday that the African National Congress (ANC) had violated human rights during apartheid, a statement that put him at odds with his deputy president. This admission came in response to the release of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission's report on the atrocities committed during apartheid. However, the report's findings have caused more division than unity among South Africans, even among former allies who fought against apartheid. The report, as expected, labeled apartheid a \"crime against humanity,\" but also criticized the ANC for its own human rights abuses during the anti-apartheid struggle."}
