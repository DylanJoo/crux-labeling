By choosing a truth commission over a Nuremberg-style trial, South Africa hoped to cleanse and heal its wounds. However, many perpetrators did not come forward, and commission officials express frustration at the lack of cooperation. Despite this, the report provides a detailed account of the nation's past, forcing the country to confront its brutal history. The TRC's work has added significantly to the knowledge of what happened in South Africa between 1960 and 1994. Nevertheless, the commission's impact will take years to be fully assessed. It remains to be seen whether the process has truly led to forgiveness and reconciliation or if vendettas will persist."}
