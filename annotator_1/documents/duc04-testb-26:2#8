{"id": "duc04-testb-26:2#8", "contents": "South Africa's TRC was seen as a model for other countries dealing with their own brutal pasts. Truth commissions have gained popularity in places like Chile, Argentina, and El Salvador. However, South Africa's commission was unique in its ability to grant amnesty and subpoena witnesses. The process has been closely watched, and its outcome will be a significant test of the effectiveness of truth commissions. As South Africa moves forward, it must balance the need for accountability with the desire to move on from its past. The country faces pressing new problems, including unemployment, crime, and a lack of resources. It may ultimately settle for a more pragmatic reconciliation, one that prioritizes moving forward over punishing past wrongs."}
