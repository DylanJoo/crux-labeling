Prosecuting Inkatha's leader, Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, could lead to new warfare in KwaZulu. The judicial system is already overwhelmed with rising crime, and the evidence from the apartheid era is old, making it a challenge to pursue prosecutions. These factors contribute to the reluctance to move forward with prosecutions, with many wondering why the time and money should be spent on pursuing justice for past crimes."}
