{"id": "duc04-testb-26:3#9", "contents": "Four years after South Africa's first non-racial elections, a growing number of South Africans want to move on from the past. Raymond Louw, publisher of the Southern Africa Report, suggests that a new amnesty proposal could be introduced during the February Parliament session, in time to avoid affecting next year's election campaigns. \"You simply can't have this country torn apart by prosecutions,\" he says. \"Everybody is going to be howling for an amnesty. They already are.\" Archbishop Desmond Tutu, chairman of the Truth Commission, has expressed concerns about a new amnesty, arguing that it would be unfair to those who came forward to testify. He proposes a two-year time limit, after which anyone not indicted would effectively receive amnesty."}
