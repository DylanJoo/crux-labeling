The party expects the accusations against it to center on the planting of land mines on border farms, abuses at its military camps in Angola, and bombings. Justice Minister Omar expects the report's conclusions to spark debate but believes it will \"lay the basis for reconciliation.\" The report will be presented to President Nelson Mandela on Thursday, and its release is expected to have significant implications for the country."}
