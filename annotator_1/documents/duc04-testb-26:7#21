{"id": "duc04-testb-26:7#21", "contents": "South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission issued its final report, detailing findings on gross human rights violations committed by the former state, security and law-enforcement agencies, and other political groupings. The Commission found that the South African state became involved in criminal activities, including extrajudicial killings and cover-ups, during the late 1970s to early 1990s. The state acted in collusion with certain groups, notably the Inkatha Freedom Party (I.F.P.). The Commission holds certain members of the State Security Council responsible for deliberate planning that led to gross human rights violations, including the use of words that implied the killing of political opponents."}
