The ruling African National Congress (ANC) is also seeking to block the commission's findings about its conduct during the liberation struggle, citing human-rights violations such as torture, killing of spying suspects, and bombings in civilian areas. The ANC plans to seek an injunction to prevent the release of the report. The commission's report is expected to lay blame on the former white government for atrocities, but it has also found the ANC responsible for human-rights violations."}
