{"id": "duc04-testb-26:9#28", "contents": "The Truth and Reconciliation Commission's report is expected to be a broad and detailed summary of South Africa's human rights history, from 1960 to 1994. The report will parcel out moral condemnations and recommend individual prosecutions. However, the commission has faced criticism and controversy, with some arguing that it has been a \"theatrical act\" and that it is a waste of money. Others, like Pal Martins, a former member of the ANC's armed wing, believe that the commission has done its work, citing the fact that all sides of the political spectrum are in an uproar. The commission's chair, Desmond Tutu, said that more than 400 people had been notified that they would be implicated in the report, and that 15 had successfully argued themselves out of the report or could not be reached and were therefore deleted."}
