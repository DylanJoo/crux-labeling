{"id": "duc04-testb-26:9#29", "contents": "The debate surrounding the Truth and Reconciliation Commission has been intense, with many South Africans divided on its value and purpose. Some, like Roboy Vonholdt, a sheep and ostrich farmer, believe that the commission is a \"mockery of justice\" and that the country should focus on moving forward and making money. Others, like the ANC, argue that the commission is essential for uncovering the truth and promoting reconciliation. The ANC has accused the commission of trying to \"criminalize\" the liberation struggle, and has stated that it will always be proud of what it did to fight against the apartheid regime. The commission's report is expected to be released soon, and it will be interesting to see how it is received by the South African public."}
