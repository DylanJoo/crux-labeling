The countries cut interest rates in a surprise move that won market confidence. Ten of the 11 countries joining the European economic union dropped their key interest rate to 3 percent, with Portugal making the most significant plunge, from 3.75 percent. Austria made the smallest cut, from 3.2 percent. Italy, which cut from 4 to 3.5 percent, is expected to drop to the common rate by the time the euro is launched."}
