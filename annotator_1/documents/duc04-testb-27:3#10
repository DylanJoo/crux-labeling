Technology has made this mobility accessible to mid-level managers, young entrepreneurs, and even students. The widespread use of cable television has also helped spread the idea of European unity to the masses, allowing Germans to watch Italian game shows or Swedes to watch French news programs. This has led to a greater recognition of European leaders and a sense of shared culture."}
