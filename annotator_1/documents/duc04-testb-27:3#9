{"id": "duc04-testb-27:3#9", "contents": "Twenty-five years ago, the European Union was formed, allowing for freedom of movement within six countries of the Common Market. This meant that a Frenchman could work in Holland, and an Italian could work in Germany without a permit. At the time, economists predicted huge migrations of unskilled laborers from southern countries to the more prosperous north. However, as industries like steel shrank in the 1970s and '80s, job opportunities for working-class Europeans also decreased. Today, there are 15 countries within the European Union, but only a small percentage of citizens have moved to other countries, mostly finding jobs in the service industry as waiters, maids, or garbage collectors."}
