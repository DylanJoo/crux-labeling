{"id": "duc04-testb-27:4#13", "contents": "London has become a hub for cosmopolitanism, attracting individuals from all over Europe who seek to escape the rigid social structures of their home countries. For instance, Tony Smith, 36, editor of several Portuguese magazines in Lisbon, seized an opportunity to study in Vienna 14 years ago and never looked back. He has lived all over Europe, speaking multiple languages, including Portuguese, Spanish, German, French, and Serbo-Croatian. His father, a car mechanic, had not traveled out of Britain until 1992. Smith credits his success to his ability to transcend the class distinctions that prevail in England."}
