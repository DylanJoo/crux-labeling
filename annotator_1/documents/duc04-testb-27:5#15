This phenomenon is not unique to Mrs. Iliffe, as Haspeslagh himself has done the same thing 25 years ago. As a Belgian who studied business at Harvard, he now lives and teaches in France and does consulting work all over Europe. His experiences reflect the growing trend of transnationalism among Europeans, who are increasingly looking beyond their national borders for opportunities."}
