Ten of the 11 countries adopting the euro have dropped their interest rates to 3 percent, with Italy reducing its rate to 3.5 percent from 4 percent. This coordinated move is a significant step towards economic union, particularly as center-left governments in Germany and France had been pushing for lower rates to boost growth and reduce unemployment, which stands at 10.9 percent in the euro zone."}
