German central bank president Hans Tietmeyer stated that the move was not a dramatic step and was not made in response to political pressure from Finance Minister Oskar Lafontaine. Tietmeyer also reassured that the rate cut does not signal a shift from the Bundesbank's steady-hand policy, and promised that it could lead to a reduction in current pessimism and financial market turbulence."}
