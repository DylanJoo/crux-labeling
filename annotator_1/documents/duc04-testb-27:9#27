When asked by Le Monde daily if he would step down after four years, Duisenberg responded, \"I had hoped you wouldn't ask me that question. The answer is no.\" This decision comes after Duisenberg was named as the head of the European Central Bank, which will govern the policies of the euro, the new single currency set to go into effect on January 1."}
