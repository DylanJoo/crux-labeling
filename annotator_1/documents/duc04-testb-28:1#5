Libya has agreed to a trial in a third country and believes that it ought to be possible to find answers to all other outstanding issues. However, the United States expressed disappointment that Libya has not complied with U.N. Security Council resolutions, which require the turnover of the two suspects for trial. Annan left for the United Arab Emirates to attend a summit of the Gulf Cooperation Council, while the Lockerbie issue remains unresolved."}
