The U.N. imposed sanctions on Libya in 1992, banning air travel to and from the country, in an attempt to force Gadhafi to surrender two Libyans wanted in the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am jetliner over Lockerbie, Scotland. Farrakhan has repeatedly called for an end to these sanctions. In 1996, he was awarded a $250,000 prize by Gadhafi for human rights work, but was prohibited from accepting it by the U.S. Treasury Department due to the sanctions and U.S. regulations."}
