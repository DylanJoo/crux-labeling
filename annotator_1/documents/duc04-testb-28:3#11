However, it is not considered a true Muslim sect by others who practice Islam. Farrakhan's message to America's black community emphasizes self-reliance, discipline, spirituality, and separatism. He has been known for his controversial statements, including calling for racial segregation and making derogatory comments about Jews and whites. Farrakhan has accused the news media of taking his comments out of context, but his rhetoric has been widely criticized."}
