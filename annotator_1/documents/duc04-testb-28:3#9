State-run Libyan radio reported that Farrakhan expressed his well-wishes, stating that improved health will enable Gadhafi to \"carry on his leading role in the service of Islamic causes in the world.\" Farrakhan's visit to Libya was his fifth in the past three years, with his most recent visit occurring in December 1997. The meeting took place at Gadhafi's ceremonial tent in the Libyan capital, Tripoli, where Gadhafi was seen dressed in a brown robe and holding a cane."}
