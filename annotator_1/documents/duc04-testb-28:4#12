Gadhafi arrived by land for \"a visit of brotherhood and rest\" at the invitation of President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali. The Libyan leader met with Ben Ali and several government ministers in a desert oasis at Tozeur, 400 kms (240 miles) south of Tunis, where foreign leaders are entertained. Tunisian television did not show Gadhafi, but officials confirmed the meeting took place."}
