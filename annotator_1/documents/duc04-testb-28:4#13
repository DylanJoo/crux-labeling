Gadhafi was first driven to Gabes, 365 kms (200 miles) south of Tunis, after crossing the border at Ras Jedir where he was met by Interior Minister Ali Chaouch. It was Gadhafi's first known trip abroad since he broke a bone near his hip while exercising and underwent surgery in July. The Libyan leader last visited Tunisia in January 1996, when he met Ben Ali in the southern town of Medenine."}
