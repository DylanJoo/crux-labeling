{"id": "duc04-testb-28:4#14", "contents": "Libya has struggled with U.N. Security Council sanctions since 1992, which ban direct flights to and from the country. The sanctions were imposed to force Gadhafi to surrender two Libyans wanted in the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am passenger plane over Lockerbie, Scotland, that killed 270 people. The U.N. has agreed to suspend the sanctions once Libya turns the men over for a trial by Scottish judges in the Netherlands, under a U.S.-British proposal. However, Gadhafi has offered to hand them over but demands any sentences be served in Dutch or Libyan prisons."}
