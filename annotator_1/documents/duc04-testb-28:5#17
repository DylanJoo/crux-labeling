The trial is expected to be held before a panel of Scottish judges in the Netherlands, with the two suspects having the right to an appeal in the same court if found guilty. The controversy surrounding the trial has been ongoing since the Security Council imposed sanctions on Libya in 1992, which include a ban on air travel and restrictions on diplomatic personnel and oil equipment purchases. U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan met with Gadhafi on Saturday to discuss the details, but no agreement was reached."}
