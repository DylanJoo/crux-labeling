However, the issue of where the suspects would be imprisoned if convicted remains a point of contention. The United States and Britain insist that the suspects serve any sentence in a Scottish jail, while Libya wants them jailed in the Netherlands or Libya. British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook expressed \"qualified optimism\" about the talks, but emphasized that Britain will not budge on its demand."}
