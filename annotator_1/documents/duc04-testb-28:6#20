Annan was eventually taken to meet Gadhafi in a tent with a roaring fire outside. The Libyan government has suggested that Gadhafi may not have the authority to hand over the suspects, and that any decision would need to be approved by national committees and the Parliament. The U.N. sanctions against Libya, which have been in place since 1992, remain a major issue, with the United States expressing disappointment that Libya has not complied with U.N. Security Council resolutions."}
