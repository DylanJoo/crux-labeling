A Western diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, revealed that Annan would travel to Libya on Saturday to meet with authorities and address the issue. The U.N. Security Council imposed sanctions in 1992, including a flight ban, in an effort to force Libya to hand over two suspects in the bombing that killed 270 people. Neighboring Tunisia provides a land route for those traveling to Libya from the region."}
