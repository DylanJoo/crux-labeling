The letter specifically addressed Libya's objections to the United Nations sanctions imposed in 1992, which aimed to pressure Libya into handing over two Libyan nationals suspected of involvement in the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am airliner over Lockerbie, Scotland. The bombing resulted in the deaths of 270 people."}
