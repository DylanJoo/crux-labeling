{"id": "duc04-testb-29:7#19", "contents": "The Bay Islands, a popular tourist destination, have been particularly hard hit, with almost everything destroyed. 14 people have died on the island of Guanaja, and at least 9 have died elsewhere in the country. More than 72,000 people have been evacuated to shelters, and over 200 towns and villages have been isolated by the storm. The economic future of Honduras is uncertain, with crucial grain, citrus, and banana crops damaged. Rain-swollen rivers have knocked out bridges and roads, isolating La Ceiba, a coastal city of 40,000 people."}
