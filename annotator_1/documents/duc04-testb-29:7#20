Most of the 75,000 residents of coastal Belize City have left, turning the city into a ghost town. In Mexico, emergency measures have been eased on the Caribbean coast of the Yucatan Peninsula, but hundreds of people remain in shelters as a precaution. The U.S. Agency for International Development has sent helicopters to Belize and Honduras to aid in search, rescue, and relief efforts. At its peak, Mitch was the fourth-strongest Caribbean hurricane in this century, behind Gilbert in 1988, Allen in 1980, and the Labor Day hurricane of 1935."}
