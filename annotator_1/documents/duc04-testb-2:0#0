Hodler, a senior IOC official, claimed that malpractices occurred in the voting for the 1996 Atlanta Games, 2000 Sydney Olympics, and 2002 Salt Lake Games. He alleged that a group of four agents, including one IOC member, have been involved in promising votes for payment, but declined to identify them. According to Hodler, these agents charge cities winning the bid \"something like $3 million to $5 million\" after promising votes."}
