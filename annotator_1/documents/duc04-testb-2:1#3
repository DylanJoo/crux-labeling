Tsukada stated that he had never heard of such allegations and that Nagano had been selected as the host through its own efforts. The mayor emphasized that Nagano had done nothing wrong and expressed disbelief at Hodler's statement. Tsukada was the vice chairman of the Japanese committee that invited the Olympics to Nagano. Nagano has faced criticism for its large expenditures in winning the hosting rights, with over 2 billion yen (approximately $17 million) unaccounted for."}
