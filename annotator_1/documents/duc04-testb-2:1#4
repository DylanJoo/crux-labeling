This warning comes as Osaka, Japan's second-largest city, competes with Beijing, China, and other cities to host the 2008 summer Olympics. Hodler's accusations may impact Osaka's invitation activities. Nagano's selection as the host city for the 1998 Winter Games was the result of a secret vote by 88 IOC members in 1991. Nagano led in each of the five rounds, ultimately defeating Salt Lake City 46 votes to 42 in the final ballot."}
