Samaranch, the IOC president, stated that members found to have accepted bribes from candidate cities could be expelled, saying \"if we have to clean, we will clean.\" He acknowledged that the current situation was a serious problem and compared it to past difficulties, such as the Soviet boycott of the 1984 Olympics and Ben Johnson's expulsion from the 1988 Olympics. Samaranch expressed surprise at allegations made by IOC executive board member Marc Hodler of Switzerland, who claimed that agents were selling IOC members' votes for payments from bidding cities."}
