The commission is also looking into other allegations, including claims that Fiat tycoon Gianni Agnelli gave free vans to influence votes for the Italian resort of Sestriere to hold the 1997 world skiing championships. Samaranch ruled out taking the Games from Salt Lake City, saying that if necessary, the IOC would expel members found guilty of corruption.
