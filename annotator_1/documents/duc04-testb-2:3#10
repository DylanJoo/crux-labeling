Frank Joklik, president of the Salt Lake Organizing Committee, and SLOC senior vice president Dave Johnson appeared before the IOC panel for 90 minutes. Both sides declined to comment after the talks, saying the inquiry was still in process. Joklik met with IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch and other top officials to provide information and documents on the case. The controversy surrounds the scholarship fund, described as \"humanitarian aid\" by Salt Lake officials, which was allegedly used to sway votes in the 1995 election."}
