Joklik expressed concern that the case had harmed Salt Lake's image. ``I appreciate the perception of this matter is bad now,'' he said. U.S. Olympic Committee deputy secretary general John Krimsky described the controversy as ``disruptive'' for Salt Lake's image and preparations for the games. ``It doesn't do us any good at all,'' he said."}
