Samaranch stated that Hodler's comments were personal and not official. The allegations also came as the IOC continued investigations into alleged financial misconduct by the Salt Lake City group, which won the bid for the 2002 games. Hodler previously described a $500,000 scholarship fund set up by Salt Lake as a \"bribe,\" which benefited the relatives of six IOC members. Former New South Wales minister Bruce Baird also revealed that he was asked to offer bribes in exchange for votes during Sydney's 2000 Olympic bid, but refused."}
