The CPP criticized a non-binding resolution passed by the U.S. House of Representatives calling for an investigation into alleged violations of international humanitarian law committed by Hun Sen. The resolution mentioned Hun Sen's coup against his co-prime minister, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, and his violent crackdown on anti-government demonstrations in September. A copy of the resolution has been submitted to the U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations. The CPP appealed to U.S. senators to consider the resolution wisely and not approve it, claiming it would be unjust to the CPP, Hun Sen, and the Cambodian people."}
