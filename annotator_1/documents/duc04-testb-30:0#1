{"id": "duc04-testb-30:0#1", "contents": "The CPP defended Hun Sen's actions, stating that his ouster of Ranariddh was a proper response to the prince's attempts to negotiate the defections of senior Khmer Rouge rebels. The party also repeated claims that Ranariddh's party had moved rebel soldiers into Phnom Penh, although this remains unproved. The CPP dismissed the killings of nearly 100 of Ranariddh's supporters documented by U.N. human rights workers as mostly fabrications. Ranariddh and his core supporters did not return to Cambodia until a few months before the July election, which the ruling party narrowly won. Ranariddh and his opposition ally, Sam Rainsy, refused to accept the election results, alleging widespread intimidation and fraud by the CPP."}
