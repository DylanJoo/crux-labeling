King Norodom Sihanouk announced the breakthrough, which sees opposition leader Prince Norodom Ranariddh become president of the National Assembly. The agreement resolves a major political crisis and ends the deadlock that has gripped the nation since disputed elections in July. The coalition government will comprise Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party and Ranariddh's royalist FUNCINPEC party. The CPP holds a majority of 64 seats in the 122-member National Assembly, but Ranariddh's party will have a significant role in the new government. The agreement paves the way for international donors and businesses to resume operations in the poverty-stricken country, which is in desperate need of aid."}
