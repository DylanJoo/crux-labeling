The deal allows for the rapid formation of a government, which is expected to hasten Cambodia's entry into the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. The agreement also includes the creation of a new Senate, which will be headed by Chea Sim, a senior member of the CPP. The Senate will have an advisory role to the National Assembly, and its senior leaders will join the assembly, the prime minister, and the country's top two Buddhist monks in a council that will choose Cambodia's next king after Sihanouk's death. The parties will finalize the details of the Senate's composition and powers at a later date."}
