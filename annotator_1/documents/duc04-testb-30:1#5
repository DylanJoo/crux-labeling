The CPP and FUNCINPEC have been bitter enemies since the CPP narrowly won parliamentary elections in July, which the opposition claimed were marred by fraud and intimidation. The opposition had organized protests in Phnom Penh seeking Hun Sen's ouster, but these were violently dispersed. The agreement is a testament to the king's ability to broker a deal and bring stability to the country. Sihanouk had pressured both sides to reach an agreement before he leaves for medical treatment in Beijing, and his intervention appears to have paid off."}
