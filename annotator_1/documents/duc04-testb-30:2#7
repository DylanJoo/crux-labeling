The two leaders agreed to form a government on November 13 at a summit convened by King Sihanouk, ending over three months of political deadlock that followed a July election won by Hun Sen. The deal establishes Hun Sen as prime minister and Ranariddh as president of the National Assembly. A key component of the agreement is the formation of a Senate as the upper house of Parliament, to be led by CPP President Chea Sim."}
