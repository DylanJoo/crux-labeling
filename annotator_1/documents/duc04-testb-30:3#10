Hun Sen's party won 64 of the 122 seats in parliament in July's national election, but not the two-thirds majority necessary to form a government on its own. Opposition parties led by Ranariddh and former finance minister Sam Ram Rainsy have refused to enter into a coalition with Hun Sen until their allegations of election fraud have been thoroughly investigated. International monitors said the election was relatively free and fair."}
