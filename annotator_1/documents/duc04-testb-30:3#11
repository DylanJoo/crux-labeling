He warned that \"only those who want to prolong the anarchy and instability prevent efforts to set up a new government.\" Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy have remained outside the country since the Sept. 24 ceremonial convening of parliament, citing Hun Sen's threats to arrest opposition politicians following two alleged attempts on his life. The opposition leaders have asked the king to chair the summit at his residence in Beijing, but Hun Sen has rejected the proposal, saying it would be inappropriate to hold a summit outside the country."}
