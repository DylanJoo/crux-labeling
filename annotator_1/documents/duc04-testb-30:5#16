His assurances come a week before the first session of Cambodia's new parliament, the National Assembly. However, Sam Rainsy expressed dissatisfaction with the guarantee, stating that it contained indirect language and loopholes that suggest he and his Sam Rainsy Party members are still under threat of arrest from Hun Sen's ruling party. He emphasized that a clear and direct statement should be made to ensure their safety."}
