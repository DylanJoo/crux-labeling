Hun Sen and Ranariddh, co-prime ministers in a coalition formed in 1993 after a landmark U.N.-sponsored election, often clashed over power-sharing and the integration of guerrilla fighters from the crumbling Khmer Rouge. Their arguments turned bloody last year when Hun Sen ousted Ranariddh in a coup. The prince fled Cambodia and did not return until a few months before elections in July."}
