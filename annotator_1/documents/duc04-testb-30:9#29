{"id": "duc04-testb-30:9#29", "contents": "The recent elections in July saw Hun Sen's party collect 64 of the 122 parliamentary seats, but it fell short of the two-thirds majority needed to set up a new government. The opposition members of Parliament have been in hiding, fearing arrest, since the ceremonial opening of the National Assembly on September 24. A series of negotiations to forge a new government have failed, with the CPP-FUNCINPEC quarrel over the Parliament's top job being a major complication. Hun Sen's party has called on Ranariddh to return to the negotiation table, offering to make an \"appropriate concession\" to break the deadlock. However, FUNCINPEC has demanded written guarantees for the safety of its members and activities as a precondition for re-entering negotiations."}
