{"id": "duc04-testb-31:0#0", "contents": "Bulent Ecevit, who was asked to form a new government, is a former prime minister best remembered for ordering an invasion of Cyprus in 1974 that made him an overnight hero at home. The invasion, after a short-lived coup by supporters of union with Greece, has led to the division of the island. Ecevit has remained a strong defender of the cause of the Turkish Cypriots, stating that \"As long as Turkey lives, we won't allow the oppression and subordination of Turkish Cypriots at the hands of Greek Cypriots.\" This stance has been consistent throughout his career, with Ecevit reiterating his support for the Turkish Cypriots during the 23rd anniversary celebrations of the invasion in July 1997."}
