Initially known for his socialist idealism in the 1970s, he has since shed some of these views. During his tenure as deputy prime minister in a 17-month government, he supported the liberal policies of the center-right-led coalition. He has often stated that his goal is to bring stability to the government and spare Turkey from crisis. Ecevit has also worked to maintain good relations with the IMF, supporting a strict curb on public spending and approving state sell-offs."}
