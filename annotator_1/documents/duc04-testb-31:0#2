{"id": "duc04-testb-31:0#2", "contents": "Ecevit's leadership style and policies have been shaped by his background and experiences. Born in Istanbul in 1925 to an intellectual family, he studied literature at a prestigious American-run high school and took courses at Harvard University. A former journalist, he entered politics in 1957 and rose to the leadership of the Republican People's Party in 1972. Ecevit has been a staunch defender of Turkey's secular traditions and has pushed for a crackdown on Islamic radicalism. Despite being barred from politics after a 1980 military coup, he was able to return to politics in 1987 and has since maintained a reputation as a leader with a clean slate, untainted by corruption."}
