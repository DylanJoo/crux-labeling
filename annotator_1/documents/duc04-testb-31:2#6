Ecevit, who has served as prime minister three times in the 1970s, has accepted the challenge and will immediately begin working to fashion a government that can command a majority in the faction-ridden Parliament. He has suggested that although Parliament has set April 18 as the date for a new election, he might seek to remain in power for a longer period. Ecevit has stated that there are problems that will not wait until an election, and it is wrong to see this government as simply an election government."}
