They fear it will produce a Parliament just as divided as the present one, perhaps with the Islamic-oriented Virtue Party as the largest bloc. The commanders are also hoping to exclude two of the country's leading politicians, outgoing Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz and former Prime Minister Tansu Ciller, from posts in the new government. Ecevit must now try to build a government that includes their center-right parties but not them as individuals. The National Security Council has set three priorities for the coming months, including fighting religious fundamentalism, Kurdish nationalism, and criminal gangs that have infiltrated the state apparatus."}
