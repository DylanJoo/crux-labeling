{"id": "duc04-testb-31:2#8", "contents": "Bulent Ecevit is a complex figure, known for his personal honesty and his uncompromising stance on certain issues. He is a fierce nationalist and has been a hard-liner on Cyprus, and is also opposed to Kurdish nationalism. Ecevit has also been critical of Western ideologies and has flirted with anti-Western ideologies in the past. Despite this, he is seen as a moderate choice for the new government, and his Democratic Socialist Party is a closely held family fiefdom. Ecevit lives modestly and has avoided any hint of personal or financial scandal, and is known for his love of poetry and intellectual journals. However, some critics argue that he is out of touch with the times and has failed to grasp the direction of the world."}
