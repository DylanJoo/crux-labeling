Parliament Speaker Hikmet Cetin has been suggested as a likely candidate. The new appointment is expected to be made within days, according to Yilmaz. Demirel consulted with Turkey's party leaders immediately after Ecevit gave up, with most declaring themselves in favor of a government led by a lawmaker.
