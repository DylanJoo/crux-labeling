Ecevit tried in vain to form a coalition government with two rival center-right wing parties -- one led by Yilmaz, the other by former Prime Minister Tansu Ciller. Ecevut's alternate efforts to make a minority coalition with outside backing for his Democratic Left Party from Parliament also failed."}
