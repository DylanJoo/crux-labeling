{"id": "duc04-testb-32:0#0", "contents": "The case of United States vs. Microsoft Corp. is playing out against a century of antitrust laws that are broadly worded and court rulings that are ambiguous, allowing both sides to cite the same rulings to support their opposing arguments. The case focuses on Microsoft's Windows, which controls about 90 percent of all personal computers sold today. The government's objective is to curb illegal monopolistic business practices that threaten to render large parts of the economy vulnerable to the vicissitudes of a single company. Microsoft asserts that the case is intended to give the government control over which features can be added to Windows. The legal dispute is narrow, with the government arguing that Microsoft's contracts with computer manufacturers and Internet companies illegally stifle competition."}
