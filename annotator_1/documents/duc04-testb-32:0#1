The company's contracts with Internet service providers and businesses require favored treatment for Internet Explorer over Navigator in exchange for links on the Windows desktop. Microsoft claims that its contracts are legal because they produce tangible benefits for customers, including easier Internet access. However, the Justice Department argues that the bundling of Explorer with Windows 95 and the inclusion of the browser as part of Windows 98 amount to \"tying,\" an illegal practice that forces customers of one product to purchase another."}
