For example, if tying results in products that are easier to use or enables a company to recover development costs, it can be seen as a positive practice. However, tying can also be detrimental if it leads to the abuse of monopoly power. The courts have struggled to provide clear guidance on distinguishing between good and bad tying practices, which is a central issue in the legal dispute. Microsoft argues that its practice of bundling Windows and Explorer passes a \"gross\" consumer benefits test, offering an immediate benefit to consumers, regardless of potential long-term harm to competition. In contrast, the Justice Department believes that Microsoft's practices must meet a higher standard, yielding \"net\" consumer benefits that balance immediate benefits with potential long-term harm to competition."}
