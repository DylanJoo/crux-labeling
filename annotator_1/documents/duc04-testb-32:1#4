{"id": "duc04-testb-32:1#4", "contents": "Both sides in the dispute have cited various cases to support their arguments. The 1985 case of Aspen Skiing Co. vs. Aspen Highlands Skiing Corp. and the 1951 case of Lorain Journal Co. vs. United States are often referenced. In Aspen Skiing, the Supreme Court ruled that the monopolist had violated antitrust laws by canceling a ticketing agreement with a competitor, as there was no evidence that the action benefited consumers. Similarly, in the Lorain Journal case, the Supreme Court found that the newspaper's refusal to sell advertising to companies that advertised on a new radio station was an exclusionary practice that offered no consumer benefit. However, Charles Rule, a legal consultant to Microsoft, argues that these cases only rejected exclusionary practices that offered no consumer benefit, and did not address the issue of balancing immediate benefits against long-term harm."}
