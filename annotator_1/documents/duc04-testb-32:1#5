{"id": "duc04-testb-32:1#5", "contents": "Another case, Jefferson Parish Hospital District No. 2 et al. vs. Hyde, is also cited by both sides. In this 1984 case, the Supreme Court recognized that surgeons and anesthesiologists provide an integrated service. However, the court also stated that a hospital with monopoly power would not be allowed to exclude rival anesthesiologists from providing services. While this case acknowledges the importance of integrated services, it does not provide clear guidance on the consumer benefit test that should be applied to product design. As a result, the issue remains unresolved, and both sides continue to argue over the appropriate standard for evaluating the consumer benefits of Microsoft's practices."}
