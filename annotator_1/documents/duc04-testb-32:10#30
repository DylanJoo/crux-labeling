{"id": "duc04-testb-32:10#30", "contents": "Microsoft and Intel are so closely aligned that they are often referred to as a single, powerful entity, \"Wintel.\" However, Intel also employs hundreds of software engineers, mainly at its Intel Architecture Labs in Hillsboro, Ore. While Intel and Microsoft are partners, they have had conflicts, typically over the direction and pace of innovations in the personal computer industry. Federal and state investigators have focused on Microsoft's reaction to Intel's software engineers, which was expressed during a meeting at Intel's headquarters on August 2, 1995. The meeting was attended by several executives, including Gates and Intel chairman Andrew Grove. An internal Intel memo stated that Gates made \"vague threats\" about supporting Intel's competitors and that he was \"livid\" about Intel's investments in the Internet and wanted them stopped."}
