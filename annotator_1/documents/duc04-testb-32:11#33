To accelerate its entry, Microsoft licensed its early browsing software from Spyglass Inc. in April 1994. Spyglass was a small company at the time, eager to do a deal with Microsoft, and had been selected as the commercial licensee for browser technology developed by the National Center for Supercomputing at the University of Illinois. Douglas Colbeth, president of Spyglass, recalled a meeting with Jim Clark of Netscape at O'Hare International Airport in Chicago, where Clark confidently stated that Netscape would \"take Microsoft head-on.\" Colbeth thought to himself that this would only increase Microsoft's interest in licensing from Spyglass."}
