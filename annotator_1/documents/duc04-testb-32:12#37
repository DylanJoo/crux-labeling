James Barksdale, Netscape's CEO, regarded Microsoft's tactic as \"an illegal act and absolute proof that Microsoft was a monopolist.\" The Justice Department and the states agreed with Barksdale, concluding that Microsoft was illegally tying the sale of one product to another. Microsoft disputes this, claiming it has a long history of adding new features to its operating system and that Windows and Internet Explorer were always intended to be seamlessly integrated."}
