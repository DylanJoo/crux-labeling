The memo, still under court seal, describes Bill Gates as \"livid\" about Intel's investments in the Internet and quotes him as wanting them stopped. A handwritten note, also under court seal, quotes Paul Maritz, a Microsoft executive, as saying that Netscape is their \"common enemy\" and that Intel's role should be to \"fill in stuff in and around Microsoft's strategy.\" These documents were sent to the Justice Department's office in San Francisco in November 1995, in response to a Civil Investigative Demand."}
