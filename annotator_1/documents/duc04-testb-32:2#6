{"id": "duc04-testb-32:2#6", "contents": "Microsoft's defense against the government's allegations of tying Windows and Explorer together is based on the principle of functional interdependence, which requires bundling the two products. However, this principle was undercut in a previous case where a hospital was not allowed to force patients to use its panel of anesthesiologists if consumers wanted to purchase the two services separately. Microsoft will argue that this principle is not applicable in its case, citing a strong concurring opinion that called for a tougher standard for the government to meet when it alleges tying. The company will also point to several court rulings that allowed IBM to change the design of its computers in ways that made it hard for vendors to attach peripheral equipment."}
