{"id": "duc04-testb-32:2#8", "contents": "A balancing test is a complex and arbitrary process that can be difficult to apply in practice. Many antitrust experts agree that the courts have gravitated away from balancing tests towards a simpler \"predation\" test for exclusionary contracts. Under this standard, a contract is illegal only if it is intended to drive out competition and pave the way for a monopolist to raise prices later. Microsoft will have an easier time defending itself against a charge of predation than against a charge that its bundled product does consumers more harm than good. The antitrust record is littered with contradictory and ambiguous verdicts, leaving plenty of legal leeway for the Supreme Court to stiffen the spine of the antitrust law if it hears the Microsoft case."}
