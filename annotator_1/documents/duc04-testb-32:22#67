This move was seen as a natural extension of the previous case, and a Federal District Court judge agreed. However, an Appeals Court panel later overturned the ruling. Meanwhile, the Justice Department and 20 state attorneys general filed a new suit against Microsoft in May, alleging bundling, tying, and other predatory behavior. This case is scheduled for trial and is seen by some as \"Round II\" of the case dealt with in the early 1990s."}
