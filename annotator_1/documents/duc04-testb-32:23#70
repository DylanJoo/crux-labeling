{"id": "duc04-testb-32:23#70", "contents": "The authors of the book quote a Microsoft executive as saying that only with the third version of Microsoft's browser was it integrated with Windows. Microsoft rushed its first browser offerings into the market to catch up with Netscape, and then took a more ambitious approach with Internet Explorer 3.0, introduced in August 1996. This version changed the software design to use programming modules, or components, that could be put together and rearranged like building blocks. A Microsoft general manager, Ben Slivka, is quoted in the book as saying, \"IE 3.0 was the key thing because we did the componentized browser... We really made Internet Explorer part of the Windows platform.\" This timing is legally significant, as the government cites requests from personal computer makers before August 1996 to load Netscape's browser on their machines instead of Microsoft's browser, which Microsoft denied."}
