Microsoft intends to use this material as evidence that Netscape's troubles resulted largely from its own missteps rather than from any alleged predatory practices by Microsoft. However, legal experts say that this defense may be less effective in a federal case seeking court-mandated changes in Microsoft's business practices. The book quotes a former Netscape executive, Ram Shriram, as saying the company bungled a chance to win a sizable share of the browser business from America Online Inc. The government's case focuses on an earlier deal in March 1996, when America Online chose Internet Explorer as its preferred browser, and Microsoft agreed to place a startup icon for the online service on the main Windows desktop screen."}
