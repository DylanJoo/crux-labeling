{"id": "duc04-testb-32:25#75", "contents": "The case of United States vs. Microsoft Corp. is a landmark antitrust trial that is playing out against a century of antitrust laws and court rulings. The government's objective is to curb illegal monopolistic business practices that threaten to render large parts of the economy vulnerable to the vicissitudes of a single company. Microsoft asserts that the case is intended to give the government control over which features can be added to Windows. The case focuses on Microsoft's Windows, the operating system that controls about 90 percent of all personal computers sold today. The legal dispute is narrow, with the government saying that Microsoft's contracts with computer manufacturers and with companies that provide access to the Internet illegally stifle competition."}
