{"id": "duc04-testb-32:25#76", "contents": "Microsoft's contracts with computer manufacturers prohibit them from substituting Netscape Communications Corp.'s Navigator browser for Microsoft's Internet Explorer. They also prohibit them from removing from the Windows main screen, or desktop, links to sites on the World Wide Web run by Microsoft or its partners. Microsoft's contracts with companies that connect people to the Internet and with businesses that sell goods and services on the Web require favored treatment for Internet Explorer over Navigator in exchange for links on the Windows desktop. Microsoft says that its contracts are legal because they produce tangible benefits for customers, including easier Internet access. However, the Justice Department says that the bundling of Explorer with Windows 95 and the inclusion of the browser as part of Windows 98 amount to \"tying,\" an illegal practice that forces customers of one product to purchase another."}
