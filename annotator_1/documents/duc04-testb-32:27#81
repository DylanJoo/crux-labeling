The government will point out that this principle is similar to a court ruling that prohibited a hospital from forcing surgical patients to use its panel of anesthesiologists. However, Microsoft will argue that a concurring opinion in the same case called for a tougher standard for the government to meet when alleging tying. Additionally, Microsoft will draw support from court rulings that allowed IBM to change its computer design in ways that made it difficult for vendors to attach peripheral equipment."}
