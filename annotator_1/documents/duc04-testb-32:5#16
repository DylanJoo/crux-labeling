Tevanian is expected to testify about Microsoft's alleged proposal to Apple, which Microsoft denies ever making. Gosling will testify about Microsoft's dealings with Sun, particularly regarding the Java programming language, which the government claims Microsoft tried to prevent from gaining widespread acceptance. In response, Microsoft has named two new witnesses, Robert Muglia and Chris Engstrom, to counter the new allegations."}
