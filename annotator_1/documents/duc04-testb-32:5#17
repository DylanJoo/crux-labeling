Warden claimed that the government is attempting to turn the case into a \"plenary monopoly case\" similar to the IBM case. As a result, Microsoft is seeking a two-week delay, citing the need for more time to prepare a defense against the new allegations. The judge has entered an order setting the October 19 trial date, and Microsoft has filed a formal motion requesting another delay, to which a response is expected next week."}
