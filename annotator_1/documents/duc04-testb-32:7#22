The meeting, according to the Justice Department and 20 states suing Microsoft, was an attempt to divide the market for Internet browsing software, a collusion pact that Netscape rejected. Microsoft claims the meeting was routine and that the company has never tried to divide the browser market. Bill Gates, Microsoft's chairman, consulted with the Microsoft team by telephone but did not attend the meeting. Two people who attended the meeting, Netscape president James Barksdale and Microsoft's Daniel Rosen, will be called as witnesses in the trial."}
