The proposal, as outlined in notes taken by Netscape executive vice president Marc Andreessen and in Barksdale's testimony, included incentives and requirements. Microsoft would invest in Netscape, give technical information, and fine-tune its operating systems to run Netscape's software better. In return, Netscape would give Microsoft a seat on its board, license its technology, and provide advance knowledge of its product-development efforts. Netscape would also agree not to make a competing product."}
