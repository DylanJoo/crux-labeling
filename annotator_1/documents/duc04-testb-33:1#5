Lebanese newspapers have denounced the move as a \"disaster\" for peace, with the independent An-Nahar newspaper quoting Prime Minister Rafik Hariri as questioning Israel's commitment to the peace process. The front page comment in An-Nahar described the mere announcement of Sharon's appointment as \"tantamount to disaster.\" Lebanon's peace talks with Israel have also been suspended for over two years, pending progress in Syrian-Israeli negotiations. The appointment of Sharon as foreign minister has only added to the sense of pessimism and uncertainty in the region."}
