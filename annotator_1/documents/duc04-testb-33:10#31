A 19-year-old Israeli soldier, Michal Adato, was stabbed to death by a Palestinian man in the settlement of Tomer in the Jordan Valley. Netanyahu received a condolence note from Arafat, who condemned the attack. Clashes between Palestinian youths and soldiers in Hebron resulted in 32 Palestinians being lightly injured by rubber bullets during the funeral of a Palestinian protester. Netanyahu's announcement was met with skepticism, with some analysts suggesting that his decision was motivated by a desire to maintain his razor-thin majority in parliament."}
