{"id": "duc04-testb-33:10#32", "contents": "Netanyahu's decision to appoint Sharon has been perceived as a reflection of his political weakness. With a narrow majority in parliament, Netanyahu is reliant on the support of individual lawmakers, making it difficult for him to make significant decisions without their backing. Critics argue that Netanyahu has recognized the inevitability of the next redeployment, but lacks the domestic political power to carry it out on his own. This has led him to seek support from right-wing politicians like Sharon, who may be able to sway other lawmakers to support the government's decisions."}
