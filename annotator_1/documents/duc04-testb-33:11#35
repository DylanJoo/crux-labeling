{"id": "duc04-testb-33:11#35", "contents": "The appointment of Sharon as foreign minister has significant implications for the Middle East peace process. As the new head of Israel's negotiations with the Palestinians, Sharon's hardline stance is likely to exacerbate tensions and hinder progress. The Syrian-Israeli peace talks, which broke off over two years ago, are unlikely to resume anytime soon. Lebanon's peace talks with Israel have also been suspended pending progress in Syrian-Israeli negotiations. The international community will be watching closely to see how Sharon's appointment affects the already fragile peace process."}
