{"id": "duc04-testb-33:2#7", "contents": "Ariel Sharon has been a dominant figure in Israeli life for over three decades, serving as a brilliant military commander, a reckless defense minister, and an ardent conservative. However, his past actions have been marred by controversy, including his role in the massacre of hundreds of Palestinians by Christian militiamen in Lebanon in 1982. An Israeli inquiry found him indirectly responsible for the killings at the Sabra and Shatila refugee camps. Despite this, Sharon's position as leader of the conservative wing of the Likud party could help Netanyahu hold together his shaky Cabinet during negotiations with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat."}
