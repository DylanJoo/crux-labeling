He went on to fight in the 1948 Mideast war as a junior officer, where he was wounded three times. In 1953, Sharon formed an elite commando unit, known as \"101,\" which he led on raids against Palestinian guerrillas who had been attacking Israeli border villages. His military career continued to advance, and in 1956, he commanded a parachute brigade during the Sinai campaign, capturing a key pass and cutting off the Egyptian army's retreat. Sharon's military prowess was again demonstrated in 1967, when he commanded an armored division that broke through into the central Sinai Peninsula."}
