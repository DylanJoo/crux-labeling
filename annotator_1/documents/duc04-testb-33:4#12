In an interview published on Sunday, Sharon stated that even if he were to be appointed as foreign minister and lead the negotiations with the Palestinians, he would not extend a hand to Arafat. This stance is in line with Sharon's long-standing opposition to ceding West Bank land to the Palestinians. As foreign minister, Sharon would play a crucial role in reaching a final peace settlement with the Palestinians."}
