{"id": "duc04-testb-33:5#15", "contents": "Ariel Sharon has played a significant role in Israeli public life for over three decades as an unapologetic warrior, first on the battlefield and later in domestic partisan politics. With his blunt tongue and bar-scrapper's demeanor, Sharon is a polarizing figure, viewed by his critics as a caricature of right-wing intransigence and by his admirers as a living symbol of unrelenting dedication to Israel's national survival. Sharon's physical vigor and pugnacious nature remain evident at 70, and he is not considered a natural diplomat by his friends and foes alike. As a Zionist underground operative and infantry commander, Sharon has fought in virtually every major military engagement in Israel's history, including the 1948 war of independence and the 1967 and 1973 Arab-Israeli wars."}
