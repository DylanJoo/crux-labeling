{"id": "duc04-testb-33:5#16", "contents": "Sharon's military career is marked by notable achievements, including commanding the armored division that seized control of the Sinai in the 1967 war and leading Israel's armored divisions to victory in the 1973 war. However, his invasion of Lebanon in 1982 as defense minister was widely condemned, and the massacres by Lebanese Christian Phalangists of unarmed Palestinians in the Sabra and Shatila refugee camps are often associated with his name. Although Sharon was cleared of charges that he knew of and condoned the attacks beforehand, the government investigating commission held that his failure to prevent the killings constituted grounds for his dismissal from the Defense Ministry."}
