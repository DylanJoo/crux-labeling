Erekat stated that the Palestinians hope to reach an agreement quickly if Netanyahu agrees to the American initiative and stops attempting to change the references of the interim agreement. The U.S. plan on the table involves an Israeli troop withdrawal from 13 percent of the West Bank, which the Palestinians have accepted, pending security conditions they must fulfill."}
