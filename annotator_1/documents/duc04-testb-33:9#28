{"id": "duc04-testb-33:9#28", "contents": "Ariel Sharon, a 70-year-old retired general, is a prominent figure in the Likud Party and has a complicated political past. He has been involved in several military victories, but his role in the 1982 Sabra and Shatila refugee camp massacre has been widely criticized. Despite this, many Israelis see him as a strong and experienced leader who is capable of being moderate when in power. Sharon's appointment has been welcomed by the right-wing political establishment, with many believing that his involvement in the negotiations will facilitate the situation for the prime minister. Uzi Landau, a Likud hard-liner, expressed relief at the appointment, stating that he feels safer with Sharon directly involved in the negotiations."}
