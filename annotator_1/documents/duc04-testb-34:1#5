AOL has decided it needs help to preserve and strengthen Netscape's corporate software business and has brought in Sun Microsystems Inc. in a side deal. As part of the deal, AOL will own Netscape, but it will have a joint marketing and development partnership with Sun. The two companies have a longer-term objective to place them in more direct conflict with Microsoft, by combining Sun's technology prowess with AOL's powerful consumer brand, potentially creating an end-run around Microsoft's grip on desktop computing."}
