{"id": "duc04-testb-34:11#32", "contents": "As the merger between Netscape and America Online unfolds, the talented programmers at Netscape's headquarters in Mountain View, Calif., are likely to become a prime target for Silicon Valley headhunters. These code hackers may be reluctant to work for America Online, which still has a reputation as a middle-brow service catering to online newcomers. To retain these employees, stock options and other financial incentives will be offered. Marc Andreessen, Netscape's 26-year-old cofounder and executive vice president, emphasized that joining America Online presents a bigger opportunity for Netscape employees to change the world. Andreessen will become Netscape's chief technology officer for the next three or four months, until the merger is completed, and is likely to take on a similar role in the combined company."}
