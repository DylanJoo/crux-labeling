{"id": "duc04-testb-34:11#33", "contents": "The merger between Netscape and America Online may seem like an unlikely pairing, given their different corporate cultures. However, the two companies had been evolving toward each other for over a year. Netscape had transformed itself from a company reliant on software sales to one focused on advertising and other revenues from its popular Netcenter Web site and corporate electronic commerce software. This transformation was largely a reaction to Microsoft's competitive assault on Netscape's browser business. America Online's CEO, Steve Case, described Netscape as a company that had \"morphed itself\" into a business with a new model. Despite initial struggles, Netscape seems to have stabilized its business around this new model, announcing a profit of $2.7 million on revenues of $162 million in its fourth fiscal quarter."}
