The memorandum emphasizes the opportunities for electronic commerce in an environment where most people are linked to the Internet. As the merger progresses, Andreessen's role in the combined company will be crucial in shaping the company's technological direction. With his background as a young programmer and Netscape's cofounder, Andreessen is well-positioned to lead the company's efforts in electronic commerce and other emerging technologies. The merger between Netscape and America Online is expected to create a preeminent Internet company over the next decade, and Andreessen's vision will play a key role in achieving this goal."}
