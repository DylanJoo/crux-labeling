AOL's flagship online service is a hybrid, offering a gateway to the World Wide Web in addition to its proprietary service. The company also has its own Web site, aol.com, which attracts about 24 million visitors a month. The acquisition of Netscape would provide AOL with a wider range of information, entertainment, and Internet services, further establishing it as a leading portal. Meanwhile, Netscape's Netcenter traffic has slipped in recent months, to under 16 million visitors a month."}
