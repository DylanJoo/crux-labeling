The company will provide consulting services on how to merchandise and sell online, leveraging its understanding of the consumer market. This approach is expected to give America Online a competitive edge, particularly in the e-commerce sector. However, some competitors have raised concerns that America Online's electronic commerce services may be biased towards selling its own software and hardware. This perception could potentially impact the company's ability to provide objective solutions for its clients."}
