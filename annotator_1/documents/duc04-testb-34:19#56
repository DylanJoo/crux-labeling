{"id": "duc04-testb-34:19#56", "contents": "Stock prices surged to record levels on Monday, marking a significant recovery that seemed nearly impossible just two months ago. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 214.72 points, or 2.34 percent, to 9,374.27, its first record since July 17. The broader S&P 500-stock index also set a record, rising 24.66 points, or 2.12 percent, to 1,188.21. The Nasdaq composite index posted the biggest percentage gain, rising 49.21 points, or 2.55 percent, to 1,977.42. The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company issues gained 3.86 points, or nearly 1 percent, to 398.15. This surge in stock prices has left many Wall Street analysts grasping for historical parallels, with some predicting that the Dow could reach 10,000 by the end of the year."}
