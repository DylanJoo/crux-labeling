Lacovara tried to make the case that Microsoft's market share is ephemeral, suggesting that the software industry is vibrant and fast-moving, and that Microsoft could be toppled from its position at any moment. However, Warren-Boulton argued that the existence of fringe competitors in the operating system market does not mean that Microsoft does not have monopoly power. The trial also touched on the success of Apple Computer Co.'s new iMac computer, with Lacovara entering into evidence an Apple news release showing that 12.5% of iMac buyers had previously owned a Windows machine."}
