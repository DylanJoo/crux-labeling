According to William Neukom, Microsoft's senior vice president for legal affairs, the proposed deal demonstrates that Netscape and the larger software industry are healthy and vibrant, despite the government's allegations of illegal and anti-competitive practices. However, David Boies, the government's lead attorney, countered that the proposed deal is irrelevant and would not remove the obstacles Microsoft has placed in the path of competition in the industry."}
