AOL faces competition from established players such as IBM, Andersen Consulting, and Electronic Data Systems, as well as new companies specializing in e-commerce services. AOL's advantage lies in its ability to combine its 15 million-strong subscriber base with Netscape software and Sun Microsystems' hardware, offering an end-to-end solution for online merchants."}
