The proposed deal is a complex, three-way transaction involving AOL, Netscape, and Sun Microsystems Inc. AOL would acquire Netscape's popular site on the World Wide Web and its software business, while entering into a joint marketing and development partnership with Sun Microsystems to strengthen Netscape's other business of selling heavy-duty software to large corporations. The purchase, valued at roughly $4 billion, is an exchange of AOL shares for Netscape stock."}
