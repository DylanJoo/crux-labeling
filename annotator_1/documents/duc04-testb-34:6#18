{"id": "duc04-testb-34:6#18", "contents": "The outcome of the Microsoft antitrust case may be a long way off, but one thing is already clear: This is the first major e-mail trial. The government's prosecution and Microsoft Corp.'s defense, to a striking degree, are legal campaigns waged with electronic messages. The human testimony often pales next to the e-mail evidence. On the stand or in videotaped testimony, the people being questioned shrug, mumble and forget. The e-mail is alive with ideas and competitive zeal, punctuated with profanity and exclamation points. The second week of the trial ended with the prosecutors being frustrated because a lengthy cross-examination by Microsoft's lead lawyer left no time for the government to show several hours of a videotaped deposition of Bill Gates, the Microsoft chairman."}
