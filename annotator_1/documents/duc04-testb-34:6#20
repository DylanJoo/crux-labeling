{"id": "duc04-testb-34:6#20", "contents": "Microsoft has for months been preparing its e-mail defense. First, Microsoft argues, anything that looks damaging is taken out of context. ``I urge your honor,'' John Warden, Microsoft's lead lawyer, told Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, ``to view with considerable skepticism the crazy quilt of e-mail fragments that seem to form the core of the government's case.'' But Microsoft has also mounted an e-mail counterattack, culled from the millions of messages it obtained by subpoena from competitors in pretrial discovery. Warden's cross-examination ritual is to present a government witness with an internal e-mail from his company and then pose a declaration as a question. These interrogations have two refrains: Isn't it true your company does exactly what you are accusing Microsoft of doing, and isn't it true that Microsoft prevailed not because it is a predatory monopolist but because of its superior technology?"}
