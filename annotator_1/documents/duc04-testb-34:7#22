It can be a sharp contrast to formal oral testimony, so often coached by lawyers and crafted by selective memory. As Robert Litan, a former senior official in the Justice Department's antitrust division, noted, ``The e-mail record certainly makes the I-don't-recall line of response harder to sustain.'' E-mail can also be powerful ammunition for pointing to contradictions in testimony. In the Microsoft case, the government will use e-mail to attack Gates' credibility, as seen in a brief clip from his videotaped deposition."}
