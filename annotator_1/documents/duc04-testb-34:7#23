Gates said he recalled being asked by one of his subordinates whether he thought it made sense to invest in Netscape, and replied that he didn't see it as something that made sense. However, in an e-mail on May 31, 1995, Gates urged an alliance with Netscape, suggesting that Microsoft could even pay them money as part of the deal. The contradiction between Gates' deposition and his e-mail highlights the importance of e-mail as evidence in the case."}
