{"id": "duc04-testb-34:9#27", "contents": "The federal government's antitrust suit against Microsoft alleges that the company has illegally bundled its browser with the Windows operating system, thereby hindering Netscape's ability to market its own browser. Microsoft's lawyers argue that Netscape has found a new partner in America Online and no longer needs government protection. However, it can also be argued that Microsoft's aggressive tactics have forced Netscape into a distress sale. Furthermore, it is unclear whether America Online's customers will choose Netscape's browser for online transactions. America Online remains dependent on Microsoft's goodwill for favorable placement of its icon on the desktop screen."}
