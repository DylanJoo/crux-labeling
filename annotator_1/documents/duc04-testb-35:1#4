{"id": "duc04-testb-35:1#4", "contents": "The killing of Starovoitova has all the earmarkings of a contract hit, a remarkably common crime in post-Soviet Russia. Most of these killings involve business deals and corruption that has swamped the government and the economy. St. Petersburg, in particular, has been plagued by such crimes. Last year, the city's deputy governor was gunned down, and in the past two months, hitmen have claimed the lives of a legislative aide, a high-ranking city official, and a prominent banker. The toxin of corruption has infected Russian society so deeply that President Boris Yeltsin ordered an investigation into reports that his Federal Security Service had ordered the death of Boris Berezovsky, the nation's most prominent businessman."}
