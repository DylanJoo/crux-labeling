Yeltsin, calling her \"my comrade,\" declared that he would personally oversee the investigation into her death. There is a sense that a line has been crossed, and people are fed up with the violence and corruption. However, the death has also led to a round of political finger-pointing, with colleagues of Starovoitova declaring that her Communist foes in the Duma were the most likely culprits, and historian Dmitry Likachyov stating that her killing seemed to signal the \"outburst of a new Red Terror.\" The investigation is ongoing, and it remains to be seen where the recriminations and political maneuvering will lead."}
