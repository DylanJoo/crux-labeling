{"id": "duc04-testb-35:2#6", "contents": "Galina Starovoitova, a prominent leader of the Russian reform movement, was murdered in St. Petersburg on Friday, marking a terrible loss for Russia. The killing has heightened fears that Russia is slipping into an era of intolerance and political violence, particularly in the midst of economic collapse and political timidity. Initial evidence suggests that the killing was a political assassination, with Starovoitova being shot three times in the head, typical of Russian contract killings. As a member of the Russian parliament and a recently declared candidate for governor, she had been speaking out against political extremism, denouncing anti-Semitic statements, and campaigning against financial corruption in the St. Petersburg municipal government."}
