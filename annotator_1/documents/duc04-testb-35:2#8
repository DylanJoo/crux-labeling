This would be a rare exception in a nation where political violence is rarely prosecuted. Her countrymen can honor her memory by following her example and continuing to fight for democracy and human rights. As a nation, Russia must work to prevent the spread of intolerance and political violence, and ensure that Starovoitova's legacy lives on."}
