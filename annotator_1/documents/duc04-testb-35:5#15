The service was held in the grand Marble Hall of St. Petersburg's Ethnography Museum, which was packed with hundreds of people, including prominent political figures. An open casket, cloaked with black ribbons and flanked by a military honor guard, stood at the head of the hall. After the service, mourners passed grimly past the casket as classical music played. Outside, several thousand more mourners stood in the cold, waiting to pay their respects."}
