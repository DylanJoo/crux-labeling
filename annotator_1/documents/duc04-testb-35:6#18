Her badly wounded aide, 27-year-old Ruslan Linkov, regained consciousness Monday and was talking to police, who later arrested several suspects in raids around the city, officials said. The killing of such a prominent politician has caused an uproar in Russia and prompted calls from all sides for a crackdown on the country's growing lawlessness. Scores of business leaders and others have been gunned down in recent years in contract killings that are almost never solved."}
