Liberal leaders charged _ without any concrete evidence _ that Starovoitova's Communist foes in the Duma, the lower house of parliament, were the most likely culprits. Over the weekend, Interior Minister Sergei Stepashin even had to call a news conference to say there was no evidence that the Communist speaker of the Duma, Gennady Seleznyov, was involved in the killing. Seleznyov responded in kind on Monday, suggesting that the ``extremists from democratic organizations'' might have staged the murder in order to win local elections set for Dec. 6."}
