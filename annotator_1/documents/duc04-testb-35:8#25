However, the motive behind the killing remains unclear. Sergei Kozyrev, vice president of the Russian Association of Scientific Societies and a supporter of Mrs. Staravoitova, commented that the choice of target suggests a well-planned attack. He noted that the killing of a female politician in Russia is unprecedented since Stalin's time. The incident has united local democratic groups, who have set aside their past differences to combine their forces in the upcoming elections to the St. Petersburg city council."}
