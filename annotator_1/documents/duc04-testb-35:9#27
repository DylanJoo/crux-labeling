President Boris Yeltsin announced that he would personally oversee the investigation into her killing, which is widely believed to be politically motivated. Starovoitova, a 52-year-old deputy in the lower house of parliament, was gunned down on Friday night as she entered her apartment building, along with her aide Ruslan Linkov, who was critically wounded.
