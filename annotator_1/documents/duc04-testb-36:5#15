The controversy surrounding Yeltsin's intentions to run for re-election has been ongoing, with his aides insisting that he has the legal right to do so, despite the Russian Constitution's two-term limit for presidents. However, Yeltsin's first term, which began in 1991, may not be counted due to the fact that it started before the Soviet Union collapsed and the current constitution took effect."}
