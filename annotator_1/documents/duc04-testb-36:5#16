Yeltsin has publicly stated that he will not seek re-election, and the opposition has shifted its focus to demanding his early resignation. A nationwide labor action earlier this month, which drew around 1 million participants, also called for Yeltsin to step down. Additionally, Yeltsin's growing health problems, including a recent respiratory infection, have raised concerns about his ability to continue in office."}
