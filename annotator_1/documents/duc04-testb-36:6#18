However, his appearance did not silence the growing calls for his resignation. Hours after his return to work, the upper house of parliament, which has generally been supportive of Yeltsin, fell just 11 votes short of passing a motion urging him to step down over his social welfare policies. Yeltsin, 67, has a respiratory infection that forced him to cut short his first foreign visit in months on Monday. His health has been a recurring concern, and whenever he falls ill, speculation arises about his ability to govern."}
