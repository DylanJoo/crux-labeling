{"id": "duc04-testb-36:6#20", "contents": "Many Russians view Yeltsin with increasing pity, with some calling for him to step aside due to his poor health. Film director Vladimir Khotinenko said, \"I feel for him. He's clearly not a healthy person... It's time for him to step aside.\" Doctors ordered the president to stay in bed, and his spokesman had said Yeltsin would not be in the office all week. However, Yeltsin's resignation is highly unlikely, and if he were to step down or die, Primakov would take power and elections would have to be held within three months. Despite growing anti-Yeltsin sentiment, Primakov reiterated that Yeltsin has no plans to resign or call early elections."}
