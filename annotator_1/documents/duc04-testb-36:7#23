He has spent most of the last two months out of the Kremlin, holding meetings at his country home. His last foreign trip was to Britain in May, where he attended a summit of the Group of Seven leading industrial nations. Yeltsin's schedule for the week may change depending on his health, with his spokesman stating that he may need to adjust his plans if his condition worsens. Despite his health concerns, Yeltsin has a packed agenda for the week, including meetings with Uzbek and Kazak officials and discussions on regional security issues, including the situation in Afghanistan."}
