This move would allow for closer monitoring of human rights abuses in East Timor, where Indonesian troops have been accused of atrocities. The protest, attended by around 100 activists, marked the 23rd anniversary of the Indonesian invasion of East Timor. The protesters are calling for Australia to cut all military ties with Indonesia, despite Defence Minister John Moore's recent announcement that joint exercises would resume."}
