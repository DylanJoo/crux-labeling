Talks were revived earlier this year after the ouster of authoritarian President Suharto, but differences remain over the definition of autonomy that would suit all parties. Separatists want autonomy to be transitional, while Indonesia is offering East Timorese partial control of their affairs in exchange for international recognition of its sovereignty. Jakarta wants to handle foreign, defense, and financial affairs. Fears are widespread that more unrest in East Timor could derail the negotiations."}
