Despite this, immigration officials denied him entry, and he was forced to try and catch a flight out of the country. After missing the plane, Ramos-Horta was eventually allowed to enter Taiwan after the Foreign Ministry intervened, but he only went as far as the airport hotel. The duration of his stay at the airport is reported to be between four and seven hours."}
