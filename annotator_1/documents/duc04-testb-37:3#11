Chen is a prominent DPP politician, and the party claimed that the incident highlighted Taiwan's undemocratic nature. Ramos-Horta downplayed the incident before leaving for a conference in Australia, stating that he had visited many countries and that only countries like Iraq and Iran had previously denied him entry. The incident has brought attention to East Timor's struggle for independence from Indonesia, which invaded the region in 1975 and annexed it the following year."}
