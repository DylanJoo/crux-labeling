The opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) claimed that the incident was politically motivated, citing Ramos-Horta's advocacy for East Timor's independence from Indonesia. However, the Foreign Ministry had lifted Ramos-Horta's previous persona non grata status in August, making it unclear why he was refused entry by airport immigration officials."}
