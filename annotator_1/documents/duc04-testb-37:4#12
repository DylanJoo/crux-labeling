Foreign Minister Ali Alatas questioned whether Portugal truly wanted to settle the problem of East Timor, a former Portuguese colony. The suspension came after reports of a massacre of dozens of East Timorese rebels in clashes with Indonesian troops. East Timor's spiritual leader, Roman Catholic Bishop Carlos Belo, reported that between 30 and 40 people were killed near the villages of Alas and Same, with only 11 bodies identified so far."}
