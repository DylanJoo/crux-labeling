The students had occupied the provincial Parliament and vowed to stay at the governor's office, demanding a total withdrawal of Indonesian soldiers from East Timor. Meanwhile, an unidentified man, believed to be a rebel, shot and wounded a civilian in Baucau. The incident occurred as Indonesia and Portugal were engaged in talks centered on an Indonesian offer to give East Timor autonomy in return for international recognition of Indonesian sovereignty there."}
