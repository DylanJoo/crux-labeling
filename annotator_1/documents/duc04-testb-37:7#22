Most offices and shops were closed in the city of 120,000, and the governor called for calm. Organizers of the strike had called for a non-violent \"day of mourning,\" but residents reported that fires broke out in three mosques after rival gangs clashed, pelting each other with rocks. The violence is a setback for Indonesia, the world's most populous Islamic nation, which is already grappling with its worst economic crisis in decades and political turmoil following the ouster of former President Suharto."}
