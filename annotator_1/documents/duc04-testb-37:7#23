Ismalil Hasan Metareum, head of the Muslim-dominated opposition United Development Party, also urged his followers not to hit back, saying that the party's supporters should not be deceived by such provocations. The upsurge in religious violence follows months of riots and protests in many parts of Indonesia, and has raised concerns about the country's ability to maintain social harmony and stability in the face of economic and political challenges."}
