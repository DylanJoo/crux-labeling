The protesters urged the Australian military leaders to identify the Indonesian army officers trained in Australia, allowing for closer monitoring of human rights abuses in East Timor. The Australian military has been involved in joint training exercises with Indonesian troops, including elite commando units accused of atrocities in East Timor."}
