Syria, on the other hand, has accused Turkey of forming military alliances with Israel that threaten Arab security and undermine Syria's bargaining position in peace talks with the Jewish state. Turkey's military alliance with Israel has also been condemned by Iran. Furthermore, Syria has accused Turkey of threatening its supply of water by building dams on the Euphrates River, adding another layer to the complex dispute between the two countries."}
