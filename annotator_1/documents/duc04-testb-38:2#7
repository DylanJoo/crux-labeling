The Turkish daily Milliyet has speculated that Turkey could stage pinpoint attacks in the Syrian-controlled Bekaa Valley of eastern Lebanon, where Kurdish rebels are believed to maintain camps. However, Lebanese officials have denied that Kurdish rebels are based in the country. The Lebanese press has also accused Israel of inflaming the tensions, with one publisher writing that it is \"brilliant Israeli intelligence versus absolute Turkish folly.\" Meanwhile, Israeli officials have stated that Israel is not a party to the crisis and that its military cooperation with Turkey is not directed against any third state."}
