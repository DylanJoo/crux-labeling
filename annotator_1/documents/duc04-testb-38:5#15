President Elias Hrawi traveled to Damascus on Monday for a summit meeting with President Hafez Assad to demonstrate Lebanon's support for Syria. This move comes after Turkish President Suleyman Demirel warned Damascus that Turkey would not tolerate its neighbor sheltering Kurdish rebels, a claim Syria has denied. As a result, Ankara has deployed troops to its border with Syria, sparking fears of a potential attack."}
