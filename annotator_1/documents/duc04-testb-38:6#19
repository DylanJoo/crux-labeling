Syria denies the allegation. The dispute has been further complicated by Syria's accusations that Turkey is forming military alliances with Israel, which threaten Arab security and undermine Syria's bargaining position in peace talks with Israel. Additionally, Syria has accused Turkey of threatening its supply of water by building dams on the Euphrates River. Iran has condemned Turkey's military alliance with Israel."}
