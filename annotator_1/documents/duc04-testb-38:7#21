Mubarak left after a two-hour meeting without commenting to reporters. However, Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa stated that Mubarak supports dialogue in resolving disputes, rather than relying on military power and threats. Moussa emphasized that Arab support for Syria should not be perceived as hostility towards Turkey. The Syrian Foreign Minister, Farouq al-Sharaa, concurred that the situation is grave and should be handled diplomatically, rather than through confrontation or threats. Al-Sharaa expressed hope that Mubarak's upcoming visit to Turkey would yield positive results."}
