John McCain of Arizona, a conservative who tends to steer away from divisive social issues, won re-election with 68 per cent of the vote. McCain is studying the possibility of a presidential race, but believes that congressional Republicans and their leaders need to learn some lessons before any nominee can hope to win. He stated that Republicans need to be for something, such as smaller government or better education, rather than just being against everything. Polls taken late in the campaign bore out McCain's sentiments, showing that Republicans are no longer identified with issues like low taxes and law and order."}
