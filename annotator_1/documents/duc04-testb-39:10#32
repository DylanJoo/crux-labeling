Bush's ability to appeal to Hispanic voters, as well as his general electoral strength, will be an asset if he decides to run for president. His brother Jeb Bush also performed well in Florida, taking more than half the Hispanic vote. However, figures on the right saw things differently, with James Dobson and Steve Forbes criticizing Republican leaders for caving in to the president on the budget and de-emphasizing social issues. They called for a more conservative approach, with Dobson implicitly calling for the ouster of Gingrich."}
