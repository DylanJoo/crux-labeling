Democratic candidates, including Clinton and Gore, stressed their plans to build more schools and hire more teachers. In California, almost a quarter of voters named education as their most pressing concern, highlighting its importance in the campaign. The emphasis on education paid off for Democrats, who won governorships in Alabama and South Carolina against the odds, partly by emphasizing their rivals' opposition to lotteries that would help fund schools."}
