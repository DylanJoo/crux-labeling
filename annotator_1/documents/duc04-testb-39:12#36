In an interview, Carville expressed his frustration with the Democratic leadership for not being aggressive enough in the final weeks before Election Day. He argued that the Democrats have a better chance of success than expected, but that no one is taking charge to make a case against the Republicans. Carville emphasized the need to \"hammer Gingrich every day\" and questioned the strategy of not actively working to take back Congress."}
