{"id": "duc04-testb-39:13#39", "contents": "A struggle for control of the House is underway, with Rep. Robert Livingston conducting a telephone campaign that could lead to him running against Newt Gingrich as speaker. This comes after a net loss of five seats in the House for Republicans in Tuesday's elections, which many blamed on Gingrich's failure to articulate a clear message for the party and a messy budget process that contradicted Republican principles of fiscal conservativism. House Republicans are set to meet on November 18 to vote by secret ballot for their leaders, and whoever wins the Republican nomination for speaker must stand for election by the full House in January."}
