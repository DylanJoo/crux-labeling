Matt Salmon, a Republican representative, has publicly stated that he will not support Gingrich no matter what. Salmon cites Gingrich's track record of \"one failed strategy after another,\" including the impeachment process and the pork-laden budget, as the reason for his refusal. Salmon's stance is seen as a reflection of the growing dissatisfaction among some Republicans with Gingrich's leadership. Other Republicans are also questioning whether it is possible to refocus the party's message and re-energize their base without making changes to the leadership."}
