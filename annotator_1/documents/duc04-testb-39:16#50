With the Republicans controlling the House by only 12 seats, it would take just six votes against Gingrich to deny him a majority and allow Democrats to potentially elect one of their own as speaker. This prospect has led Livingston to urge Gingrich to step aside for the good of the party. Both Livingston and Gingrich are working the phones to secure votes, with Livingston reportedly considering a challenge to Gingrich's leadership."}
