However, once in power, Gingrich faced off against Bill Clinton, who co-opted parts of the Republican agenda, including balanced budget and welfare reform. Clinton's ability to adapt the Republican message and focus on issues like health care and Social Security blunted the power of the Gingrich revolution. The public was happy to be led in a different direction, and the government, once seen as the enemy, was now viewed as a potential ally."}
