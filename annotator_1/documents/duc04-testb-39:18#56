The Democrats had become a minority party, associated with cities, blacks, and immigrants, but good economic times, a drop in crime, and national welfare reform have since reduced the power of race as a wedge issue. The Democratic vote has become more diverse, with union workers, Catholics, and minorities returning to the party. The Republican Party, meanwhile, appears to be shifting towards a more moderate, pro-business stance, wary of debt and social issues like abortion. Gingrich's mistake may have been to focus on impeachment rather than issues like tax cuts, but the party's long history of opposition has left it struggling to define what it stands for."}
