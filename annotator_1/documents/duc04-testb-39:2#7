Some are envisioning a new ticket headed by Rep. Bob Livingston and including Rep. Steve Largent. Despite the discontent, Gingrich expressed confidence in his position, saying he was \"not particularly concerned\" about losing the speakership. Republicans close to him expect the anger to dissipate, but others, like Rep. Christopher Cannon, acknowledge that the party \"got shellacked\" due to a lack of agenda."}
