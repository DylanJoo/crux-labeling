{"id": "duc04-testb-39:20#61", "contents": "The Republican leadership will face a challenging task in uniting the party's competing factions, particularly with their reduced numbers. The party will need to balance the demands of hard-core conservatives who want a more aggressive social agenda with those of moderates who want the party to return to the center. The Democrats, who held 206 seats, and the independent representative will likely have increased leverage in the new House. This shift in power dynamics may even lead to ad hoc majorities being formed between Democrats and moderate Republicans, potentially undermining Republican leaders' control."}
