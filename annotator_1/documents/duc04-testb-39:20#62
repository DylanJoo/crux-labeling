Newt Gingrich, who had previously predicted significant election gains, expressed uncertainty about the results, acknowledging that he had misjudged the public's reaction to the Clinton scandal and its amplification in the media. He also conceded that the party had underestimated the need to aggressively push a stronger message on key issues such as tax cuts, Social Security, and education reform. Majority Leader Sen. Trent Lott similarly admitted mistakes, including the party's failure to present a clear message in the final stages of the campaign and the negative impact of the budget bill scramble."}
