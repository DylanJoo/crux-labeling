{"id": "duc04-testb-39:8#24", "contents": "House Speaker Newt Gingrich, the mastermind behind the Republican revolution and the impeachment inquiry into President Clinton, has been ousted from office by his own party following unexpected losses in the midterm elections. In a surprise move, Gingrich announced on Friday that he would not seek re-election as Speaker and would leave Congress altogether when his term expires in January. This decision, according to Gingrich, will allow the party to \"purge some of the poison that is in the system.\" Gingrich's resignation is a stunning reversal for a politician known for his combative and confrontational style, which has defined his career and led to the downfall of Democratic Speaker Jim Wright a decade ago."}
