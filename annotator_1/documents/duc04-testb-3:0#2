They're so skewed,'' said Michael Chan, a lawyer who upgraded his computer with a high-speed modem the day after Anwar was arrested on Sept. 20. Chan uses the modem to download pictures of balaclava-clad police in bulletproof jackets busting down Anwar's front door before bundling him off to jail. The Internet is also being used to call for organized rallies and silent protests, with Malaysians being urged to switch off all lights for 10 minutes on Oct. 6 to declare their ``state of sorrow, sadness and darkness'' over national injustice."}
