However, a second letter later emerged, stating that Aness would not proceed with the appeal. Aness' lawyers claim that the second letter was a forgery. Balwant Singh, one of Aness' lawyers, stated that Aness has instructed them to proceed with the appeal, and that there has been no change in his decision.
