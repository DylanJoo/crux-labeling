The images, which have been widely circulated in local newspapers and online, have sparked outrage and raised concerns about police brutality. Initially, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad suggested that Anwar had inflicted the injuries on himself, but he has since called for a full investigation into the matter. Mahathir emphasized that the police cannot harm detainees during interrogation, and the incident has tarnished the image of the Malaysian police."}
