{"id": "duc04-testb-3:6#19", "contents": "Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, 72, has been grooming Anwar Ibrahim, 51, as his successor, but fired him from his posts as Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister on grounds of moral unfitness. The two had differing views on economic policy, and Anwar claimed Mahathir feared he was a threat to his 17-year rule. Anwar was also expelled from the ruling party and arrested under a law allowing police to detain him indefinitely. His case has drawn international attention, with the presidents of the Philippines and Indonesia expressing concerns and the United States threatening to downgrade President Bill Clinton's visit to Kuala Lumpur next month if Anwar is mistreated."}
