Habibie has expressed concerns about attending the upcoming Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum in Malaysia due to the arrest of former Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim. Habibie's concerns stem from the perceived mistreatment of Anwar, who was fired by Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad on September 2 after the two disagreed on economic policy. Anwar was subsequently arrested on September 20 and accused of engaging in homosexual acts, which are illegal under Malaysian law. However, these charges are widely seen as a pretext for his political persecution."}
