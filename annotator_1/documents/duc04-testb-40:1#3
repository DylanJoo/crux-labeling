Hall, who has a long-standing interest in world hunger, showed photographs of North Korean children with severe malnutrition, including patchy hair, protruding bones, and open sores. He also brought back a bag of \"substitute food\" being distributed by the government, which consisted of dried leaves and straw that are indigestible and provide no nutrition. Hall stated that millions of North Koreans may have starved to death in the last few years, and that public health care has declined sharply, with hospitals lacking basic necessities like electric lights and anesthesia."}
