The delegation, led by Charles Kartman, will press for access to the site, which American intelligence agencies believe could be the centerpiece of an effort to revive a frozen nuclear arms program. The State Department has made clear to North Korea that any attempt to pursue a nuclear weapons development program would be unacceptable. The talks in Pyongyang aim to completely satisfy U.S. concerns about the suspect construction."}
