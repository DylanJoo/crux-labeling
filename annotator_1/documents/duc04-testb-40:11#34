Spy satellites have recently photographed thousands of North Koreans around the huge site 25 miles northeast of Yongbyon, the nuclear center where North Korea was believed to have stockpiled enough plutonium before the 1994 accords to build six or more bombs. North Korean officials have denied that the complex would be used to develop nuclear weapons, instead claiming it is for \"civilian underground structures\" that can be inspected if the U.S. presses for access."}
