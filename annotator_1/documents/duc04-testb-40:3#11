{"id": "duc04-testb-40:3#11", "contents": "The foundation of U.S. efforts to ease North Korea's decades-long hostility toward the South is a 1994 \"agreed framework\" in which the North halted its nuclear weapons program in exchange for a Western commitment to build modern nuclear energy sources there. However, that deal would be shattered if the suspect site turned out to be a clandestine nuclear project. Kim Dae-jung was firm in saying his government supports Clinton on the nuclear issue, emphasizing the need for full access and ways to ascertain the nature and purposes of the construction site. He also called for the North to limit its missile development, citing the \"great shock\" in Japan when the North Koreans test-fired a missile its way on August 31."}
