Kim expressed suspicion over the government's response to his inquiry about the issue, stating that the answer was \"not sufficient or sincere.\" He believes that the government might be trying to conceal the truth. The US and South Korea had previously detected a massive underground construction site near the Yongbyon complex, which North Korea has denied is nuclear-related."}
