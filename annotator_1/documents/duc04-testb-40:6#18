The request was made during meetings this week in Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, between North Korean officials and a U.S. government delegation. The United States rejected the request, with State Department Spokesman James Rubin stating, \"As we expected, the North Koreans brought up the issue of compensation, and we flatly rejected it.\" The exact amount demanded by North Korea was not disclosed, but administration officials estimated it to be hundreds of millions of dollars, with one source putting it at $300 million."}
