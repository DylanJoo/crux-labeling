They have repeatedly stated that U.S. inspectors could visit the site as long as Washington agreed to pay a large fee in compensation for what the North Koreans describe as the administration's slander. The North Korean representative at the United Nations, Kim Chang Guk, emphasized that the United States could inspect the site \"on condition that when it is confirmed not to be a nuclear facility, the United States should pay compensation for slandering and defaming my country.\" U.S. intelligence agencies fear that by building the complex, North Korea may have decided to abandon a four-year-old agreement with the United States to give up its nuclear weapons program in exchange for billions of dollars in aid."}
