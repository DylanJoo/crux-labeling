During a joint news conference at the Blue House, Clinton warned North Korea's communist leaders not to miss an opportunity to make lasting peace on the peninsula. Kim pledged his government's full support for the U.S. endeavor to resolve the nuclear question, calling for full access for U.S. inspectors at the North Korean underground facility. Clinton acknowledged that U.S. intelligence officials are not certain that the site is nuclear-related, but emphasized the need for access to it. The situation raises strong suspicions, and the North risks closing the door on cooperation if it refuses a U.S. inspection."}
