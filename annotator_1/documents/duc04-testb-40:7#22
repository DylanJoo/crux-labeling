If the suspect site is proven to be a clandestine nuclear project, it would jeopardize preliminary North-South peace talks that could produce a treaty to replace the 1953 armistice. Kim firmly stated that his government supports Clinton on the nuclear issue, demanding full access and ways to ascertain the nature and purposes of the construction site. He also emphasized the need for the North to limit its missile development, citing the shock in Japan when the North test-fired a missile in August."}
