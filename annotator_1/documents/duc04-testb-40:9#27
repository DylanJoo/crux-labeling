The Clinton administration is concerned that the construction of a new complex in North Korea may be evidence that the country has abandoned its 1994 pledge to give up its nuclear weapons program. The North Koreans have denied that the complex is intended to help build nuclear weapons, but they have demanded that the United States pay $300 million to inspect it. The US has rejected this request, and the Clinton administration plans to resume negotiations with North Korea over inspecting the site in December."}
