{"id": "duc04-testb-41:2#6", "contents": "Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi lost a confidence vote in Parliament by a single vote, ending his two-and-a-half-year tenure as the second-longest serving prime minister since World War II. The collapse of his government marks a return to the chronic political instability that has plagued Italy for decades. Prodi will remain in charge as a caretaker prime minister until a new government is formed, but his weakened position will make it difficult for him to persuade Parliament to approve NATO strikes or pass the 1999 budget. The budget is necessary for Italy to join the single European monetary unit, the euro, on January 1. Prodi's resignation has sparked uncertainty over Italy's participation in NATO military actions in Kosovo, as well as its ability to meet the requirements for euro membership."}
