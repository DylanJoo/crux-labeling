{"id": "duc04-testb-41:3#10", "contents": "The crisis has caused divisions within the Communist Refoundation Party, with leader Armando Cossutta resigning as party president in opposition to the decision to withdraw support from Prodi's government. Cossutta has expressed concerns that the party's actions could lead to early elections, which would likely result in a victory for the right. Prodi has stated that he will not engage in \"political gymnastics\" and will instead act with coherence. The break with Prodi's government has also led to speculation that he may reopen negotiations with the communists in an attempt to win back their support."}
