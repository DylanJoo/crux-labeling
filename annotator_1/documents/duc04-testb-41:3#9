{"id": "duc04-testb-41:3#9", "contents": "Italian Premier Romano Prodi has announced his intention to appeal directly to Parliament in an effort to save his government, which is on the verge of collapse due to the withdrawal of support from its Communist ally, the Communist Refoundation Party. The party's decision to pull out was prompted by Prodi's deficit-cutting 1999 budget, which is crucial to Italy's participation in the European common currency. Prodi has stated that he will call a confidence vote if he loses the Communists' support, and this vote is expected to take place on Friday. The outcome of this vote will determine whether Prodi's 2 1/2-year-old, center-left alliance will stand or fall."}
