If the bill is not passed, negative signals would be sent to global financial markets that are already upset due to the financial crises in Asia, Russia, and Latin America. Prodi's backers are still hoping that a sufficient number of Communist Refounding deputies will break ranks and back the budget when it comes up for a vote in Parliament later this week. If that fails, a centrist group led by former President Francesco Cossiga has announced it will support the budget, thus at least assuring parliamentary passage. However, the future of Prodi's coalition remains highly uncertain."}
