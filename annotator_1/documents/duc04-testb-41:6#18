{"id": "duc04-testb-41:6#18", "contents": "Italy's president, Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, has begun meeting with political leaders to find a consensus on a new government following the collapse of Premier Romano Prodi's center-left government. The talks, which are expected to last several days, will determine the next steps for Italy's government. Scalfaro may ask Prodi to form a new government with a new majority, or he may name a new premier or appoint a government of technocrats. If no candidate can muster a majority, Scalfaro could call early elections, which would have to be scheduled by December due to the president's term limitations."}
