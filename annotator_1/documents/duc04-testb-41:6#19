Despite support from a breakaway faction of the Communists, Prodi lost the vote of confidence by a single vote. Prodi has stated that he will not take the job back unless his new government can adhere to the policies of its predecessor, which seems unlikely given the divided Parliament. Alternative candidates, such as Massimo D'Alema, leader of the Democrats of the Left, have been mentioned as potential successors."}
