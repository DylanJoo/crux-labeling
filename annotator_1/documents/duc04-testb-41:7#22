Armando Cossutta, the leader of the moderate wing, resigned as party president, citing the party's hardline stance as \"wrong and dangerous.\" Prodi is hoping to capitalize on the break and gain the support of some of the party's members. The government currently needs four more votes to secure a majority in the Chamber of Deputies, the lower house of Parliament. Despite the challenges, Prodi's government has a majority in the Senate."}
