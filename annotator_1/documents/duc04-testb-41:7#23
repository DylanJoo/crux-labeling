The government's longevity has been largely due to the shared desire to see Italy qualify for the 1999 debut of Europe's common currency, the euro. However, with Italy having already qualified, the disparate allies no longer have a clear reason to stay together. Prodi has outlasted all but one of his predecessors, Bettino Craxi, who served for 3 1/2 years in two back-to-back stints from 1983 to 1987."}
