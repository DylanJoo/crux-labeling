He expressed a willingness to force new elections, which could return the right to power, stating that sometimes one must take a step back to move forward. However, the communist rank and file have disagreed with this view in the past. When Bertinotti forced Prodi to offer his resignation last year over proposed budget cuts, the rank and file protested, and he was forced to backpedal. Prodi met with President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro and coalition leaders to devise a strategy, and is expected to go to Parliament to open debate on the crisis and seek enough votes for the budget."}
