{"id": "duc04-testb-41:8#26", "contents": "Without the budget, the Italian central bank is unlikely to cut its key lending rates, which is necessary for Italy to align with Germany and other European neighbors before the introduction of the single European currency, the euro. Even if Prodi gathers enough votes to pass the budget, he could still be left without a majority. Prodi's government is the second-longest in the postwar era, but the fragile center-left coalition has held together mostly due to a united effort to meet the requirements for euro membership. Now that this goal has been achieved, dissension has revived, and Prodi is faced with unappetizing choices: resign and seek new elections, or form a new majority without the Communists by seeking an alliance with the small center-right party of Francesco Cossiga."}
