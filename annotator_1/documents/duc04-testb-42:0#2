He suggests investing in companies already partially owned by another firm, such as Houston Exploration, Longs Drug Stores, and the Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co. LaLoggia also recommends National Presto Industries, a maker of housewares and electrical appliances, which is trading near its low for the year and has a significant cash balance, no debt, and a 5% dividend yield."}
