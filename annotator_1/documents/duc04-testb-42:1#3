Oil stocks led the way, with Exxon and Mobil's potential merger creating the world's largest oil company. Internet and computer stocks also rallied, thanks in part to America Online's purchase of Netscape Communications. At the same time, Germany's Deutsche Bank and Bankers Trust are scheduled to formally announce their merger on Monday. According to Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer at the First Albany Corp, \"There is no question that the merger euphoria is the headline,\" but also noted that the flow into mutual funds is also strong."}
