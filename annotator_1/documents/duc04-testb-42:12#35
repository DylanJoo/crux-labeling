The source stated that \"the prospects were good\" for completing an agreement. Exxon and Mobil confirmed on Friday that they were discussing ways to combine, but cautioned that no agreement had been reached and there was no assurance they would reach one. The statement sent the stock of both companies surging, suggesting investors believe the companies will combine. Shares of Exxon, the biggest U.S. oil company, rose $1.6875, or 2.3 percent, to $74.375, while shares of Mobil, the No. 2 U.S. oil company, rose $7.625, or 9.7 percent, to $86."}
