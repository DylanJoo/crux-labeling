If Exxon and Mobil ultimately do combine, the costs could prove heaviest for energy industry employees. Analysts say that of the about 80,000 global employees at Exxon, based in Irving, Texas, and the more than 40,000 at Mobil, in Fairfax, Va., thousands would be likely to lose their jobs. Oil companies were everybody's favorite targets during the trust-busting era early this century and again during the Arab oil embargoes of the 1970s. Now they seem especially vulnerable as demand weakens in much of the world, especially in economically troubled Asia, weighing further on already depressed prices."}
