The Energy Department has predicted that oil prices will remain low for nearly a decade, with a potential drop of $5.50 a barrel in the year 2000. In response, companies are forming partnerships to reduce costs, such as Mobil's agreement with British Petroleum to combine their European refining and marketing operations, resulting in annual savings of about $500 million. Shell and Texaco have also formed a refining partnership in the United States."}
