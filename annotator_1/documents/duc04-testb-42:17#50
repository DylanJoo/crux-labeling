{"id": "duc04-testb-42:17#50", "contents": "Times are tough in the oil patch, with low petroleum prices and high capital costs of exploration squeezing both Big Oil and small oil. The recent agreement between British Petroleum and Amoco to merge, as well as the consideration of a merger between Exxon and Mobil, highlights the challenges faced by the industry. Philip K. Verleger Jr., publisher of Petroleum Economics Monthly, believes that the changing dynamics of the oil business are driving these mergers. Verleger notes that the most promising, untapped fields are often located in exotic locales, making exploration a costly endeavor. With West Texas crude trading at around $12 a barrel, it's unlikely that oil prices will reach the $100 a barrel mark predicted by some analysts in the early 1980s."}
