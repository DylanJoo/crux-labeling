He notes that Mobil has been trying to get bigger, but questions the role of Lucio Noto, Mobil's chief executive, in a potential merger. Verleger believes that Mobil's size makes it a marginal player in the industry, and that only companies with the deepest pockets will be able to stay in the game in the next century. He points to Exxon's brutally efficient approach to exploration and production, which has allowed it to weather the downturn in prices better than Mobil. Verleger also agrees with the Energy Department's forecast that oil prices will stay soft for nearly a decade, but believes that prices will eventually rebound as the Asian economies grow again."}
