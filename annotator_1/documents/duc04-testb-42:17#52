He believes that oil stocks are still a worthwhile investment, but cautions that investors should be careful and not expect to make money over the next 9 to 12 months. Verleger notes that there will be a good deal of consolidation among smaller companies during this period, and that investors should be prepared for a period of low oil prices before prices eventually rebound. He predicts that oil prices could drop as low as $5 a barrel in the short term, but will eventually rise to around $20 a barrel as the OPEC countries strengthen their position and the Asian economies grow again."}
