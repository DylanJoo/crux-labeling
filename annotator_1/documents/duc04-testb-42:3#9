{"id": "duc04-testb-42:3#9", "contents": "Exxon's Beaumont refinery, a major provider of livelihoods in the area, has become the focal point of concerns about job security and the future of the petrochemical industry. The refinery, built almost under the spray of the nearby Spindletop gusher, has been the prime provider of jobs in the area since its construction. However, with mounting overtime and a workforce that is mostly balding or going gray, it is clear that the refinery has been more concerned about reducing its workforce than attracting new employees. The cutbacks have come through attrition, with retirements often encouraged by incentives, but the plywood sheets covering the windows of local businesses advertise that the best times are long gone."}
