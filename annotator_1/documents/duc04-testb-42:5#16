Exxon was formerly known as Standard Oil of New Jersey, while Mobil consisted of Standard Oil of New York and Vacuum Oil. Both companies have a history of being fiercely independent, but the current low oil prices have forced them to consider consolidation. Exxon has a market value of $176.7 billion, while Mobil's market value is $61.1 billion. The companies have already implemented cost-cutting measures, but the prolonged period of low oil prices has made it necessary for them to explore alternative options."}
