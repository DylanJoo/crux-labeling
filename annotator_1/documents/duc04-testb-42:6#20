However, analysts and investment bankers are divided on the logic of such a deal. Some argue that the companies have too much overlap in their domestic refining and marketing businesses, making it difficult to see the benefits of a merger. Others believe that the combination of the two companies would be logical, particularly in the current market environment. If a deal were to be proposed, it would likely face several months of scrutiny from the Federal Trade Commission, which would review the potential impact on the industry."}
