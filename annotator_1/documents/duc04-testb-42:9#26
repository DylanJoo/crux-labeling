This has led them to focus on their own exploration areas, such as the deep waters in the Gulf of Mexico and West Africa. However, this type of exploration is extremely expensive, and even when large fields are discovered, it often requires massive investments, including platforms costing $1 billion, to bring the oil into production. As a result, oil prices have been under pressure for over a year, declining by more than 40% from the $20-a-barrel level due to growing inventories of petroleum and declining Asian demand caused by the economic crisis in the region."}
