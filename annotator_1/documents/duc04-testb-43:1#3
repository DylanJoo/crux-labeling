According to Fatos Klosi, the head of Shik, Bin Laden's network has sent units to fight in Kosovo, a neighboring Serbian province. The network consists of individuals from various organizations, including Egyptians, Saudi Arabians, Algerians, Tunisians, Sudanese, and Kuwaitis. Klosi believes that terrorists have infiltrated other parts of Europe through a traffic in illegal immigrants, who have been smuggled across the Mediterranean to Italy in large numbers."}
