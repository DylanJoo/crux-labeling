This has raised concerns that terrorists may be using Albania as a base to operate in other parts of Europe. The apparent confirmation of Bin Laden's activities in Albania came during the murder trial of Claude Kader, a French national and self-confessed member of Bin Laden's Albanian network. Kader claimed that he had visited Albania to recruit and arm fighters for Kosovo and that four of his associates were still at large."}
