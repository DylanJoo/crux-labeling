This operation has allowed him to establish a network of terrorists in the region, who have been involved in various activities, including fighting in Kosovo. The discovery of Bin Laden's network in Albania has significant implications for European security, as it suggests that terrorists may be operating in other parts of the continent, using false papers and other means to evade detection."}
