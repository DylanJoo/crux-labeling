The Taliban, who control about 90 percent of the country, closed their three-week inquiry into allegations that bin Laden is waging a war of terror against the United States. Afghanistan's chief justice, Noor Mohammed Saqib, stated that the inquiry was concluded due to a lack of evidence presented by America, rendering bin Laden \"a man without sin\" and a free individual."}
