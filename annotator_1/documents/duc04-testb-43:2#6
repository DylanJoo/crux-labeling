Identified in court papers as CS-1, this senior aide pleaded guilty to terrorism charges in a secret proceeding in U.S. district court in Manhattan. The informant worked closely with bin Laden from 1989 to 1996, during which time prosecutors claim bin Laden ordered deadly attacks on U.S. soldiers in Somalia and elsewhere. The informant has provided crucial information to federal investigators, including details cited in papers filed to support the extradition of two associates of bin Laden who are under arrest in Germany and Britain."}
