The source's identity remains unknown, but government officials have declined to comment on the matter. However, at least one operative of bin Laden's group in East Africa suspected that Sidi Tayyib, a businessman married to one of bin Laden's relatives, was a turncoat. Tayyib was reported to have cooperated with Saudi and U.S. authorities, providing details of bin Laden's bank accounts and businesses."}
