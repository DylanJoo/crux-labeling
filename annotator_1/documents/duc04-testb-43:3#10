He notes that the US sees every danger connected to bin Laden and is afraid of him in every part of the world. In contrast, bin Laden is considered an honored guest in Afghanistan, and the Taliban cite Afghan tradition, which demands that a host guarantee their guest's protection. Saqib claims that he has no evidence of bin Laden's involvement in terrorist activities, and the Taliban have refused to turn him over to the US."}
