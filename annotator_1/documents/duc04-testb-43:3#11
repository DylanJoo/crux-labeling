Saqib's inquiry is set to conclude on November 20, and if no evidence is found against bin Laden, the case will be closed, at least for the Taliban. Saqib emphasizes that the US has not provided any evidence against bin Laden and that it is shameful for America to pursue him without reason. He expresses a desire for good relations with the US and other countries, but insists that they must respect the Taliban's ways."}
