In an interview with The Associated Press, Saqib stated that the US is looking for a reason to fire more rockets on Afghanistan, and that reason is bin Laden. This comes after the US launched a missile attack on suspected terrorist camps in eastern Afghanistan on August 20, killing 26 people, in retaliation for the August 7 bombings of US embassies in East Africa, which Washington blames on bin Laden."}
