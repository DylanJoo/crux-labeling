Salim, a 40-year-old Sudanese national, was arrested on September 16 near Munich by Bavarian authorities acting on a U.S. warrant. Under German law, U.S. officials have 40 days from the date of arrest to submit supporting evidence, allowing a German court to rule on the extradition request. A Bavarian Justice Ministry spokesman, Gerhard Zierl, confirmed that U.S. authorities had asked the court for an additional 20 days to provide the required material."}
