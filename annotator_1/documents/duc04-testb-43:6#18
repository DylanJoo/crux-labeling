{"id": "duc04-testb-43:6#18", "contents": "U.S. intelligence officials have obtained new evidence linking the owner of a Sudanese factory destroyed in a U.S. cruise missile strike to a terrorist group backed by Osama bin Laden. The evidence shows that Salih Idris, the owner of Al Shifa pharmaceutical plant in Khartoum, has had financial dealings with members of Islamic Jihad, an Egypt-based group responsible for the assassination of President Anwar Sadat in 1981. Islamic Jihad, in turn, receives money and sponsorship from bin Laden and has been absorbed into his terror network. A spokesman for Idris denied the accusations, stating that Idris had no ties to bin Laden or any Islamic terrorist groups. Idris claimed that he had never met bin Laden, spoken with him, or had any financial or business relationship with him or his agents."}
