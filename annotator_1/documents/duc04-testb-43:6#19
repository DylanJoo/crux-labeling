{"id": "duc04-testb-43:6#19", "contents": "The new evidence comes as President Clinton faces criticism over his decision to strike the Shifa plant. Some State Department and CIA officials have objected to the decision, arguing that it was based on tenuous evidence of a connection between the plant and bin Laden. The criticism is also based on the suspicion that the United States has poor data on Sudan, as the CIA station there has been closed since 1995 and the entire U.S. Embassy since 1996. Additionally, more than 100 intelligence reports from a CIA informer in Sudan were withdrawn in January 1996 because they proved to be fabrications. Senior administration officials say that at the time of the cruise missile strike, they had evidence of Sudan's involvement with bin Laden in a chemical weapons program, but no direct evidence linking the Shifa plant directly to that effort."}
