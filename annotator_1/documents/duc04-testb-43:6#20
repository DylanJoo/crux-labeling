Officials are not certain what the Iraqis are doing in Khartoum, but intelligence agents previously obtained evidence that the manager of the Shifa plant made frequent trips to Iraq, where he visited the head of the chemical weapons program. A soil sample taken at the Shifa plant showed the presence of a chemical used in the production of VX nerve gas, a process used only by Iraq. The CIA had begun to scrutinize the plant 18 months prior to the attack, but believed the plant's ownership was irrelevant. After the missile strike, when Idris was publicly identified as the owner, U.S. intelligence began to investigate his possible connections to chemical weapons and terrorism."}
