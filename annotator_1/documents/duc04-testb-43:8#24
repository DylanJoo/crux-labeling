The author, believed to be Haroun Fazil, wrote an angry dispatch complaining that the organization had declared war against the United States, yet he had only learned of it through the news media. He noted British press reports about the arrest of an aide to bin Laden, worrying that \"an important man with close links\" to bin Laden had \"fallen into the enemy's hands\". Fazil also mentioned that the Americans were closing in on his associates in Nairobi, prompting him to take precautions. \"The cell is at 100 percent danger,\" he warned."}
