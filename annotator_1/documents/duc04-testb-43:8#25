The computer was seized in August 1997 during a raid by Kenyan authorities, attended by an FBI agent. The documents did not specify whether the FBI had translated and read the document before or after the bombings of the U.S. Embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, on August 7, 1998. The timing is crucial, as there have been questions about whether the United States adequately followed up on warnings of a possible terrorist attack on American targets in Kenya. Officials of the FBI and the U.S. attorney's office in New York City refused to comment on when the FBI learned of the computer file."}
