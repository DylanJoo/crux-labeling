The author refers to himself as the media information officer of the East Africa cell, complaining that he is not being kept informed of big decisions. He mentions following events on CNN and using the Internet to communicate. The document appears to confirm two central charges against bin Laden: that he had planted a terrorist cell in Nairobi and that his operatives carried out attacks on American soldiers in Somalia in 1993 and 1994. Fazil, who remains a fugitive, eluded American investigators as he traveled from Kenya to the Middle East."}
