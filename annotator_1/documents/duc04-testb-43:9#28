Fawwaz, who served as an informal press spokesman for bin Laden in London, was arrested by British authorities in September after the embassy bombings. He has denied any connection to terrorist activities. A translation of the report was part of a package of documents American prosecutors have sent to Britain to support the extradition of Fawwaz for trial in New York."}
