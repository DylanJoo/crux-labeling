He stated that Home Secretary Jack Straw would use only strictly legal criteria in making a decision on an extradition request from Spain. The tone of Blair's statement contrasted with that of Trade Secretary Peter Mandelson, who had previously expressed his opposition to diplomatic immunity for Pinochet. The European extradition convention gives Garzon 40 days to present a formal extradition request to the British authorities via the Spanish government."}
