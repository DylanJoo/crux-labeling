Santer emphasized that crimes should not be left unpunished, regardless of where they take place. Pinochet was detained by British police in London on October 16, following a request from a Spanish magistrate, as a step towards his extradition to stand trial for genocide and terrorism. Santer acknowledged the suffering and exile inflicted on many citizens during Pinochet's regime, which lasted from 1973 to 1990."}
