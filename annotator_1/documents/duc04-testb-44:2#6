{"id": "duc04-testb-44:2#6", "contents": "Efforts to extradite former Chilean dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet have begun in Geneva and Paris, while his lawyers in London argue against the Spanish arrest warrant. In London, Pinochet's lawyers claim that the general has diplomatic immunity as a former head of state and that the arrest order is illegal because he is not a Spanish citizen. They also argue that if Pinochet is extradited, Queen Elizabeth II could be extradited to Argentina to face trial for the death of Argentine soldiers in the Falklands war. The British government lawyer, Alun Jones, defends the Spanish warrant, stating that Pinochet is responsible for killing at least 4,000 people and had set out to destroy a national group of Chilean nationals who did not share his ideological values."}
