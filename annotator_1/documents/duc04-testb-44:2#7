The prosecutor is asking the Swiss federal government to seek Pinochet's extradition from Britain to face trial in Geneva. In Paris, the families of three French citizens who disappeared or were killed in Chile during the 1973-90 dictatorship have filed suit in a French court, and a human rights group has filed a suit on behalf of a woman whose father disappeared in Chile in 1973. In Madrid, the Spanish investigating magistrate who first obtained Pinochet's arrest has formally requested the governments of Switzerland and Luxemburg to block bank accounts held by the general."}
