His detention was based on a warrant issued by a Spanish magistrate, who is seeking to extradite him on charges of genocide, terrorism, and torture committed during his 1973-1990 rule in Chile. The Chilean government has urged Britain to release Pinochet on humanitarian grounds, arguing that as a senator, he is entitled to diplomatic immunity."}
