{"id": "duc04-testb-44:6#19", "contents": "Pinochet's arrest was instigated by a Spanish magistrate, who cited 94 victims in the warrant, although the charges could potentially be broadened to include up to 3,000 people who were killed or disappeared during Pinochet's 17-year rule in Chile. However, Chile is arguing for Pinochet's release, citing his diplomatic immunity as a senator and his poor health. Unconfirmed reports in Chile suggest that Pinochet, who has worn a pacemaker for years and is diabetic, may also be suffering from a urinary tract infection and depression."}
