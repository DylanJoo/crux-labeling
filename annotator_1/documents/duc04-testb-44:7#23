The Chilean government has acknowledged that 4,299 people were killed or disappeared during his rule. Pinochet's arrest has sparked a diplomatic row, with Chilean Ambassador Mario Artaza stating that his country has a duty to protect a citizen with diplomatic immunity and senator status. The ambassador emphasized that Chile is not defending Pinochet's record as a dictator but rather his status as a senator. A Chilean specialist in international law is set to travel to London for further meetings with British officials to discuss Pinochet's case."}
