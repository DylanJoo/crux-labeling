This decision comes despite a Spanish judge's petition to freeze any accounts Pinochet may have in Luxembourg and Switzerland. The Spanish judge, Baltasar Garzon, had ordered Pinochet's arrest and is seeking his extradition on charges of genocide, torture, and terrorism committed during his 17-year rule in Chile, which ended in 1990."}
