{"id": "duc04-testb-44:8#25", "contents": "Although no accounts have been frozen in Switzerland, the country has requested Pinochet's arrest and extradition on separate charges of murder, kidnapping, and torture. This move was prompted by a criminal complaint filed in Geneva by the widow of Alexis Jaccard, a student of Swiss-Chilean dual nationality who disappeared in May 1977. Swiss authorities have stated that the Spanish effort to extradite Pinochet should take priority over their own request."}
