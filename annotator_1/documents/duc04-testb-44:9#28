Relatives of victims of Pinochet's regime have welcomed the move, while his supporters have taken to the streets in opposition. The delegation argued that Chilean problems should be dealt with by Chilean courts, and that Spain should not interfere in their internal affairs. Espina emphasized that Chile had been an independent nation for 188 years and would not become a Spanish colony again. However, Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar has stated that his government will support a formal extradition request if asked to do so by the judicial authorities."}
