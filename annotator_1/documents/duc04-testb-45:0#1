However, Saqib claims that he has yet to find any evidence of bin Laden's involvement in terrorist activities. The Taliban has refused to extradite bin Laden to the United States, citing Afghan tradition which dictates that a host must guarantee their guest's protection. Instead, the Taliban has offered to try bin Laden under Islamic law if evidence of his wrongdoing is presented. Saqib's inquiry is set to conclude on November 20, and if no evidence is found, the case will be closed."}
