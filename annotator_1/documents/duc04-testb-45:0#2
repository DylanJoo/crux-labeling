He believes that the U.S. sees bin Laden as a threat everywhere, and that this fear is driving their actions. The Taliban, on the other hand, views bin Laden as an honored guest and is committed to protecting him. Saqib has expressed a desire for good relations with the United States and other countries, but emphasizes that these relationships must be based on mutual respect for their ways and traditions."}
