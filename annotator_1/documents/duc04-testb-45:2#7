They stated that two of the defendants have not been able to call their families, while the third has been allowed to make only one phone call. Additionally, the defendants are not allowed to have visitors, write letters, or receive mail or books. One of the lawyers, Bruce McIntyre, who represents Wadih el Hage, told the judge that he is not even allowed to give his client a dictionary. El Hage has been charged with conspiring to kill Americans abroad and has been described by the government as a former personal secretary to Osama bin Laden."}
