The raids, which involved agents from an elite anti-terrorist unit, targeted several suspects in an industrial zone and other locations. However, no arrests were made during the operation. According to Eva Schuebel, spokeswoman for the Federal Prosecutor's Office in Karlsruhe, the agency had received \"credible information\" that Middle East terrorists had stockpiled arms and explosives at the sites, but none were found."}
