{"id": "duc04-testb-45:5#15", "contents": "Federal prison officials have taken the extraordinary step of cutting off virtually all communications for two men being held in Manhattan in connection with the bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. The restrictions were imposed under a rarely used federal rule that allows prison officials to limit an inmate's contacts in order to prevent future \"acts of violence and terrorism.\" This provision, approved by the Justice Department, permits officials to segregate prisoners from other inmates, and to cut off their correspondence, visits, interviews with the news media, and use of the telephone. However, it does permit communications with their lawyers."}
