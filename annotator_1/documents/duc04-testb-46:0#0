{"id": "duc04-testb-46:0#0", "contents": "It is fitting that this most memorable of baseball seasons should conclude with a World Series that opens Saturday night in Yankee Stadium, the aging but still grand cathedral of the sport. Bedecked in bunting and banners, the revered ballpark always elevates the game with its aura of history and accomplishment. That makes it the perfect venue for part of a championship series that will determine whether the 1998 Yankees are one of the greatest teams of the modern era, or just a talented squad that owned the regular season but folded in the World Series. New Yorkers are a boisterous, boastful bunch, and the patter of the city this week has been loud and arrogant, or so it must seem to anyone venturing here from San Diego to root for the Padres."}
