{"id": "duc04-testb-46:0#2", "contents": "The doubts keep creeping up. The team was pitiful at the plate through most of the playoffs. Tino Martinez, the top run producer, has been in a numbing slump. Bernie Williams, the American League batting champ, hit well in the pennant series against the Cleveland Indians, but has seemed distracted by personal matters. Shane Spencer, the rookie slugging sensation of September, hasn't turned out to be the new Mr. October. Pettitte has been struggling since August. The curious thing about this team, which won more games during the regular season than any team in American League history, is how quiet and unobtrusive it can be. It sports no dominant superstar, no swaggering clubhouse leader, no one who seems to belong in New York."}
