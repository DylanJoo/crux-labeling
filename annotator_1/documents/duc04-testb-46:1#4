But after Saturday night, Garcia will move to right field Sunday night for Game 2. Now why does that combination sound familiar, Richie Garcia and right field? Ah yes, the last time Garcia worked a post-season series at Yankee Stadium, he was the umpire in Game 1 of the league championship series two years ago when a young fan from New Jersey reached over the fence and caught Derek Jeter's fly ball just as Tony Tarasco, Baltimore's right fielder, prepared to catch it. Garcia ruled no interference, that it was a home run, then said oops after watching a television replay clearly showing interference. Too late. The call helped the Yankees win the first game and set the tone for the series. ``Even though he made a mistake, you know you have the best out there,'' a baseball official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said."}
