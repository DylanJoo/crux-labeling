{"id": "duc04-testb-46:11#33", "contents": "YANKEES Pitching The starting pitching enabled the Yankees to advance past Cleveland in the American League Championship Series. David Wells is 7-1 in his career in the postseason and he should have an additional edge against a Padres' lineup that is generally less effective against left-handed pitching. Orlando Hernandez has four terrific pitches, pitched seven shutout innings in the pivotal Game 4 of the ALCS and earned the start in Game 2 of this series. David Cone should benefit from six days' worth of rest when he starts Game 3, as well as being able to pitch in warm Southern California. Mariano Rivera's stuff might be as good as it has been all year, and Mike Stanton continues to be a dominant postseason pitcher."}
