{"id": "duc04-testb-46:12#37", "contents": "They mostly catch the ball and avoid mistakes, though they are unspectacular. Shortstop Chris Gomez and the second baseman Veras are adept at turning double plays, and Caminiti won a Gold Glove at third base last year; Wally Joyner has good hands at first; the center fielder Steve Finley is extremely quick in tracking down base hits and returning the ball to the infield. Tony Gwynn's range is better toward the right field line, not nearly as good on balls hit in the gaps. The Yankees will be able to run on the arm of Vaughn in left field. Baserunning Veras can steal bases (24) this year, and Finley can in a tight spot, as well."}
