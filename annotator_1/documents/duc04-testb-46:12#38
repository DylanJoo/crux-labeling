{"id": "duc04-testb-46:12#38", "contents": "In general, however, the Padres are a slow, plodding team, though Caminiti and Vaughn are good at going first-to-third, and Gwynn won't make mistakes on the bases. Quilvio Veras: A switch-hitter who has more power right-handed; should try to pitch him down-and-in with breaking balls when he's hitting right-handed, jam him with fastballs when he's batting left-handed. Steve Finley: A left-handed hitter who likes to pull the ball. Left-handers like David Wells can beat him with breaking balls low and outside. Tony Gwynn: When he's hot, he's impossible. When he's not hitting well, he can be anxious early in the count, and he should be fed breaking balls out of the strike zone."}
