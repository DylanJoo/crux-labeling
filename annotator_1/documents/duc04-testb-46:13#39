{"id": "duc04-testb-46:13#39", "contents": "When it comes to hitting, the Yankees have a diverse range of styles and strengths. Ruben Rivera is an impatient hitter who will chase pitches out of the strike zone, while Carlos Hernandez looks for the first-pitch fastball in the upper half of the strike zone but can struggle against breaking balls. Jim Leyritz, on the other hand, has no apparent holes in his game and can hit fastballs in and away, making it best to get ahead in the count and try to get him to chase breaking balls. Chuck Knoblauch is often jammed with fastballs by hard throwers because he stands on top of the plate, which is why he gets hit so often."}
