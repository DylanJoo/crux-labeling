{"id": "duc04-testb-46:13#40", "contents": "Paul O'Neill is the Yankees' best pure hitter, but he sometimes chases fastballs up and away, particularly after there is one strike. Bernie Williams, a switch-hitter, has trouble resisting chest-high fastballs, but when he lays off them, he is a much better hitter. Chili Davis has a great eye and will work a pitcher deep into a count, but he can be overpowered with fastballs above his belt. Tino Martinez is currently struggling, chasing pitches out of the strike zone when he falls behind in the count and not taking advantage of mistakes when they're made."}
