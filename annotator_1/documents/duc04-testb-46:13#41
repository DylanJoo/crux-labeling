{"id": "duc04-testb-46:13#41", "contents": "On the pitching side, Kevin Brown has a sinking fastball, a four-seam fastball, a slider, and a forkball in his arsenal. He holds runners well and is likely to attack Ricky Ledee aggressively. David Wells is an aggressive pitcher who challenges hitters with fastballs, and his curveball and changeup are also effective. He has a tendency to throw strikes, having allowed as many home runs as walks this year. Scott Brosius is a great breaking ball hitter, but can also drive a fastball a long way when he anticipates, while Jorge Posada struggles against splitters, curveballs, and sliders when batting left-handed."}
