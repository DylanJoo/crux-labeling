{"id": "duc04-testb-46:3#11", "contents": "San Diego's Greg Vaughn had a big at-bat in the second inning, hitting a home run off Wells to tie the game. Vaughn had hit 50 home runs during the regular season, and he was a threat every time he stepped up to the plate. Wells got ahead in the count, but then tried to run a fastball inside on Vaughn, who hit a line drive that landed in the second deck, foul all the way. After a visit from catcher Jorge Posada, Wells threw an outside fastball, but Vaughn was ready, hitting the ball over the wall in right-center field to tie the game."}
