To his relief, there were no boos, only a warm ovation from the crowd. They had forgiven him, and it made him feel at home. Knoblauch had emphasized before the game that he was focused on winning and advancing to the World Series, not on the fans' reaction. However, the positive response undoubtedly lifted his spirits."}
