{"id": "duc04-testb-46:6#18", "contents": "San Diego's enthusiasm for the Padres is evident in the city's recent activities. On Friday morning, 680 fans shaved their heads for a radio promotion raffle, with a 1-in-680 chance to win skybox tickets for post-season play. The event, organized by the \"Jeff and Jer\" show, was more a show of support for the team than a chance to win the ticket. The turnout was overwhelming, with about 1,000 people attending, including men, women, and children. The event took six hours to complete, with 10 barbers and 20 hairdressers working tirelessly to buzz or straight-razor the participants' hair. The event's success was a testament to the city's bandwagon spirit, with fans eager to jump on the Padres' bandwagon."}
