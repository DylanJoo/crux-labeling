After the team beat the Braves 3-0 in Game 2 of the National League Championship Series, fans began gearing up for a potential World Series appearance. The team's attendance record of 2,555,901 this season is a significant increase from previous years, thanks in part to the efforts of owner John Moores and president Larry Lucchino to create a family-friendly atmosphere at the park. The team's diverse fan base, which includes families from different generations, has been a key factor in its success. Fans like Donna McMahon, who has been attending Padres games since she was 10, have seen the team's fan base grow and diversify over the years."}
