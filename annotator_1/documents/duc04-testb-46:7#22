{"id": "duc04-testb-46:7#22", "contents": "The three-tiered playoff system has changed the dynamics of baseball, making it more like football, where only one team is crowned the champion, and the rest are left feeling like losers. The World Series used to be a short and sweet reward for excellence, but the introduction of league championship series in 1969 and the two-layered playoff system in 1995 has changed that. The World Series is still a unique competition between two leagues with different approaches to the game. However, the \"playoffs\" have left many teams feeling inadequate, including the Houston Astros, Texas Rangers, Chicago Cubs, Boston Red Sox, and Atlanta Braves."}
