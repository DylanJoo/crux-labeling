Strawberry, who underwent surgery to remove a cancer from his colon on October 3, said he will remain in New Jersey for another 10 or 12 days before returning home to Rancho Mirage, California. The 36-year-old outfielder, who lost a significant amount of weight from his 215-pound frame, said he does not have enough strength to attend any of the World Series games and is content watching his teammates play the Padres on television."}
