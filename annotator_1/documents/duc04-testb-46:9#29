Paul O'Neill echoed the sentiments of many Yankees by saying, \"Everything we're going through is game. This is his life. Any time we get some good news about Darryl it's uplifting. We're all praying for him.\" When Strawberry was released from the hospital, a few hundred fans chanted \"Darryl, Darryl,\" and he hugged a few nurses, thanked everyone for supporting him, and carefully entered a car."}
