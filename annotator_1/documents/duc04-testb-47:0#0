The deaths _ and the ostentatious display of the heads by killers _ prompted neighboring Russian regions to close off roads into Chechnya, and caused an outpouring of outrage and lament from Russian and foreign officials. Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov said Wednesday that one alleged kidnapper had been arrested and authorities gleaned enough information to launch a rescue operation for the hostages, three Britons and a New Zealander. But during the rescue attempt the kidnappers panicked and decapitated the captives, Maskhadov said, according to Russian media reports."}
