The tape showed the four men, including Peter Kennedy, Darren Hickey, Rudolf Petschi, and Stanley Shaw, who were employees of Britain's Granger Telecom and were abducted on October 3 in Grozny while setting up a mobile phone network. Kennedy claimed in the tape that they were sent to Chechnya by the British secret service to monitor telephone conversations and gather information to stop the spread of Islamic extremism in the region."}
