Chechen acting First Vice Premier Turpal Atgeriyev, who is heading the investigation into the killings, said authorities had several suspects in the abduction, but have failed to make any progress. Maskhadov blamed the rash of abductions in Chechnya to unidentified ``outside forces'' and their Chechen henchmen. He said the deaths of the four men were a major blow to Chechnya and its efforts to gain international recognition of its independence. Hostage-takings, usually for ransom, have become common in Chechnya since the end of the breakaway republic's two-year war for independence from Russia in 1996."}
