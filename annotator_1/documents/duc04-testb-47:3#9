An Associated Press reporter saw the severed heads near the village of Assinovskaya, about 40 kilometers (25 miles) west of Grozny, the Chechen capital. He did not see any sign of the bodies. The heads were lined up on a piece of cloth along a main highway across southern Russia, NTV television reported. The hostages were engineers working for Granger Telecom, a British telephone company, installing 300,000 telephone lines across Chechnya."}
