Since Chechnya's two-year war of independence against Russia ended in 1996, hundreds of people have been kidnapped by armed gangs motivated by ransom. Dozens of people are currently held captive, including a Russian soldier who was released on Friday after a year of efforts to free him. The release of Cochetel and the soldier, Alexei Novikov, brings hope to the families of those still being held captive in the region."}
