In a separate development, a Russian soldier taken hostage during the war was released after a year of efforts to free him. Alexei Novikov was seized in February 1996, and his release was reported by ITAR-Tass on Friday. The report gave no details of his release, but it was a rare positive development in the ongoing conflict in Chechnya, where hundreds of people have been kidnapped, mostly for ransom, since the two-year independence war with Russia ended in 1996."}
