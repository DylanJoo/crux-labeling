Alexander Dzasokhov, the president of North Ossetia, stated that Cochetel was liberated on the border. The release comes as a relief, particularly in light of the recent discovery of the severed heads of four foreign hostages in Chechnya. French President Jacques Chirac expressed his gratitude to President Boris Yeltsin for Russia's role in freeing Cochetel."}
