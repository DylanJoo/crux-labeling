The ruling Communist Party has resorted to the state security law to crack down on opposition since it went into effect last year. Xu and Qin are influential figures in the dissident community, having started their campaign for change 20 years ago in the seminal Democracy Wall movement. Wang Youcai, a third leading advocate of the China Democracy Party, has been in custody for a month and has been accused of \"inciting the overthrow of the government.\" All three men could face up to life in prison if convicted of the harshest measures under China's state security law."}
