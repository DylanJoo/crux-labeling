Yao's family, including his wife and 14-year-old daughter, were constantly followed by secret agents, and their business was shuttered by the government in 1996. Democracy activists in China urged Yao to go abroad to reveal the truth about the situation in China and to call for international attention. Yao was granted a special visa by the US government, which expires in February."}
