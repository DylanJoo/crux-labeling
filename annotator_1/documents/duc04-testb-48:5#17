However, its most vocal leaders have recently been detained, according to Beatrice Laroche, liaison at the United Nations for Human Rights in China. The Yao brothers, particularly the younger Yao, gained prominence by financing predecessors of the China Democracy Party with money from their family business before it was closed by the government. Last week, the Chinese government arrested 10 members and sympathizers of the party, with one member, Wang Youcai, set to go on trial on December 17."}
