{"id": "duc04-testb-48:6#18", "contents": "Wang Youcai, the leader of the suppressed China Democracy Party, is scheduled to be tried on December 17 on charges of colluding with foreign enemies of China \"to incite the subversion of state power.\" The trial is expected to be secret and swift, and could result in a sentence of five years or more. Wang has been imprisoned in his home city of Hangzhou for a month, and was formally arrested on November 30. The charges against him are part of a larger crackdown on dissent by the Communist authorities, who are determined to destroy the fledgling party and silence dissidents who have begun to speak out over the past year."}
