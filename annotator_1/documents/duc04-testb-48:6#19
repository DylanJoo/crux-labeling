Other prominent dissidents, such as Qin Yongmin and Xu Wenli, have also been detained on suspicion of subversive activities. Qin and Xu have a long history of advocating for democracy in China, with Qin spending eight years in prison and Xu serving 12 years. The formation of the China Democracy Party, announced by Wang during President Clinton's visit to China in the spring, was seen as a bold move by the dissidents, who hoped to capitalize on China's newfound friendship with the US and its signing of a global covenant on political and civil rights."}
