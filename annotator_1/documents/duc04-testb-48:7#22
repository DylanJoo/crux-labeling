He took the police reference to \"reactionary groups\" to mean exiled dissidents in the United States. Under China's State Security Law, such links may also be punishable by up to life in prison. Zha pledged to work with dissidents in China and exiles in the United States to campaign \"to save Xu Wenli.\" Meanwhile, 190 dissidents from around the country demanded in an open letter that the government release Xu, Qin, and Wang Youcai, saying the arrests run counter to U.N. human rights treaties China has signed."}
