Qin Yongmin, a 45-year-old democracy advocate, has spent 10 years in prison and labor camps and has recently promoted an alternative, non-Communist political party. The elder Qin intends to hand the court a written plea for postponement before the trial begins and will walk out if it is ignored, citing his frail health and high blood pressure."}
