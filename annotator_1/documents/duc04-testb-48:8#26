Wang, a 33-year-old leader of the suppressed China Democracy Party, also lacks a defense lawyer. The party's founding and Wang's public announcement of its charter during President Clinton's visit to China had raised hopes for a looser political climate. However, the party was declared illegal, and many adherents were detained. Wang now faces charges that could result in a prison sentence of five years or more. A third dissident, Xu Wenli, is also expected to face similar charges."}
