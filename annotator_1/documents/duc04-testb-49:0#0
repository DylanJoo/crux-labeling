The decree, which was proposed to accumulate money in a special National Bank account, would repay people in case the bank they kept their savings in went bankrupt or became insolvent. However, leftist factions, which voted against the proposed legislation, argued that it would not fully guarantee the return of savings lost during the recent financial instability in Ukraine."}
