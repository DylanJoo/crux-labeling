After two weeks of deliberations, he announced that he still has no plan to rescue the country, stating \"I want to repeat once more - there is no program... It has yet to be worked out.\" This statement might have provoked alarm in most nations, but Primakov's intention was to calm an anxious public worried that the Kremlin's cure could be worse than the disease. The economic woes of Russia have been a significant concern, and Primakov convened a meeting of top aides to hammer out a strategy to overcome them."}
