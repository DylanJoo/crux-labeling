The plan, which was published in full by Kommersant Daily, calls for a greater state role in the economy, including controls on hard currency. It proposes the establishment of a new State Bank for Reconstruction and Development using the \"nationalized assets\" of failed commercial banks. The plan also includes measures such as paying wages and pensions in two months, indexing the minimum wage to inflation, and implementing huge tax cuts. However, critics argue that these measures could lead to the government printing additional money, and the plan's proposal for currency controls has been met with skepticism."}
