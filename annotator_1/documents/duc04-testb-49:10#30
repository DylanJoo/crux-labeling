The U.S. influence on the IMF is significant, despite its limited 18.5 percent vote in the fund. In practice, the U.S. usually gets its way, often through behind-the-scenes interactions between top officials like Stanley Fischer, the IMF's deputy managing director, and Lawrence Summers, the U.S. Treasury's undersecretary for international affairs."}
