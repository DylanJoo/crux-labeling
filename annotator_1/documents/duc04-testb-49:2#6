However, the question remains what the marchers will be demonstrating against, given that the Communists are now in power and running the country and its economy. President Boris Yeltsin and his economic advisers were previously easy targets, but Yeltsin's influence has waned, and his advisers are gone. The Communists are working to maintain the focus of the protests on Yeltsin and his policies, despite being part of the government."}
