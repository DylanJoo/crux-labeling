{"id": "duc04-testb-49:2#8", "contents": "A survey by the All-Russian Public Opinion Center found that nearly half the population supports the idea of demonstrations against Yeltsin, but only one-tenth are likely to participate. The Communist Party and the Federation of Independent Russian Unions predict that 9 million Russians will participate, but the government has vowed to keep order without resorting to force. The authorities are concerned enough to have summoned 11,000 police officers and 6,000 military troops to intervene if necessary. Despite the planned demonstrations, there seems to be little enthusiasm, with only a few thousand people turning out for a recent anniversary event."}
