Central Bank Chairman Viktor Gerashchenko and Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov traveled to Washington for negotiations with the IMF over the $4.3 billion installment. However, Primakov stated that the country's plan would be dependent on the IMF loan, not the other way around. The IMF has expressed concerns that currency controls and increasing the money supply by printing rubles are not acceptable."}
