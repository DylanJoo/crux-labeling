{"id": "duc04-testb-49:4#12", "contents": "Wall Street extended a global stock selloff Thursday with the Dow industrials tumbling more than 200 points for a second straight day. The Dow Jones industrial average, which plunged 237.90 points on Wednesday, fell an additional 210.09, or by 2.7 percent, to close at 7,632.53. Broader market indicators also sank sharply in heavy trading. Bank and technology stocks were particularly hard hit. The selling spree, amid worries about shrinking corporate profits and fears of new financial crises, left the Dow 18.3 percent, or more than 1,700 points, below the all-time high of 9,337.97 reached on July 17."}
