Yields on 30-year Treasury bonds fell further below 5 percent Thursday, reaching levels unseen for long-term government bonds since 1967. Traders were alarmed to see prices on the New York Stock Exchange nosedive 2.9 percent on Wednesday, even though the Federal Reserve had lowered a key interest rate one-quarter percentage point on Tuesday. Some traders were disappointed that the cut was not deeper amid fears a go-slow approach would not do enough to counter the economic crises that have swept through Asia and Russia and are threatening Latin America."}
