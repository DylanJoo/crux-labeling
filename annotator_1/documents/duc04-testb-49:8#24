Camdessus, a former French army officer, and Suharto, a general in central Java, came from different worlds of power politics. The IMF official recalled that Camdessus told Suharto that he had to dismantle the national airplane project, the clove monopoly, and all the distribution monopolies. Camdessus also mentioned the impact on Suharto's family, who had vast investments in the country's key industries.
