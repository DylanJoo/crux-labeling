The World Bank, the IMF's sister institution, has been a vocal critic, accusing the IMF of prioritizing economic stability over poverty alleviation. The World Bank has gone to great lengths to differentiate its role from that of the IMF, tripling aid to the poorest countries affected by the crisis. Even UN Secretary General Kofi Annan has weighed in, warning that globalization must benefit both the rich and the poor, and that it must be harnessed to promote development and prosperity for the poorest."}
