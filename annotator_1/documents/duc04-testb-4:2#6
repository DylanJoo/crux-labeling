Hariri accused Lahoud of allowing 31 Parliament deputies to authorize him to name a prime minister, rather than following the constitutional procedure of naming one themselves. This action, Hariri warned, could put the country in danger. In a live interview with CNN, Hariri stated that he was not a candidate for the position of prime minister and demanded that Lahoud acknowledge the alleged constitutional violation before he could reconsider his position."}
