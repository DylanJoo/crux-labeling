Lahoud, who has just begun his six-year presidential term, is seeking to assert his authority, while Hariri has had a significant amount of control over the country since becoming premier six years ago. A meeting between the two leaders on Monday failed to resolve their differences. Hariri's Cabinet has been serving in a caretaker capacity since Lahoud's inauguration last Tuesday, and the president has scheduled a fresh round of consultations with Parliament to choose a new prime minister."}
