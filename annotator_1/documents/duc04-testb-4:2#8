He is credited with restoring economic confidence and stabilizing the national currency, and his efforts to secure international financial aid and investment have been instrumental in the country's reconstruction efforts. However, he has also been criticized for declining living standards and a rise in corruption in government. Lahoud has pledged to address these issues and has widespread popular support after rebuilding the army fractured by civil war. Central bank officials have sought to calm fears about a run on the Lebanese pound, stating that they are ready to intervene with foreign currency reserves if necessary."}
