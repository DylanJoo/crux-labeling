He also stated that the rules were not respected in the nomination process and that things were supposed to run in a more democratic way. Jumblatt's opposition to Syria's hold on Lebanon's politics is rare, especially since Syrian President Hafez Assad personally cleared Lahoud's nomination. Like Jumblatt, some in Lebanon fear that a military man as president could lead to increased intelligence surveillance, similar to what occurred during the presidency of Fouad Chehab."}
