Lahoud, a 62-year-old naval officer, enjoys wide public and political support and has good relations with Syria. He is credited with reuniting the army and ending the reign of militias, and many hope he will cleanse the government of corruption and wastage of public funds. Jumblatt's party will also boycott a Parliamentary session to amend the Constitution to allow senior public servants to run for president."}
