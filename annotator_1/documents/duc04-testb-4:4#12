Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri congratulated Lahoud on the telephone, as reported on the front page of the leftist newspaper As-Safir. The matter was settled in a meeting between outgoing President Elias Hrawi and Syrian President Hafez Assad in Damascus. Lahoud is expected to be elected by the 128-member Parliament on October 15, a formality since other candidates have little chance now that Syria has thrown its weight behind him."}
