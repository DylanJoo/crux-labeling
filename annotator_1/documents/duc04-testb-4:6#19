The British-trained general made his name rebuilding the army after it disintegrated in the civil war. Previous disputes among government leaders have cost the Central Bank hundreds of millions of dollars in its efforts to stabilize the Lebanese pound. Such political disputes in Lebanon in the past were solved only with the intervention of Syria, the main power broker in this country. Damascus supports both Lahoud and Hariri."}
