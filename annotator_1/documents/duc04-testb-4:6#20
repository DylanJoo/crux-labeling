The sources close to Hariri said the prime minister's decision to bow out came because he did not feel Lahoud was following constitutional procedures in selecting the premier. The Hariri camp argues that the president can poll Parliament members on their choice for prime minister but cannot accept a mandate to name a person of his choice. Toward the end of former President Elias Hrawi's nine years in office, Hariri virtually had a free hand in running the country."}
