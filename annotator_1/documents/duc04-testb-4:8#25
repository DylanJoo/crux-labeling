{"id": "duc04-testb-4:8#25", "contents": "The tension between Hariri and Lahoud has been building since Lahoud's inauguration last Tuesday. Hariri's Cabinet has been serving in a caretaker capacity, and Lahoud has scheduled a fresh round of consultations with Parliament to choose a new prime minister. Hariri was offered the opportunity to form the next government but declined, after receiving a majority but not near-unanimous backing from legislators. Hariri is credited with restoring economic confidence and stabilizing the national currency, but has been criticized for declining living standards and rising corruption. Lahoud has pledged to clean up the graft-riddled administration and enjoys widespread popular backing."}
