{"id": "duc04-testb-5:0#2", "contents": "Turkey has requested Ocalan's extradition to face terrorism-related charges, which could carry the death penalty. The Greek daily Eleftherotypia has argued that Ocalan should be allowed to remain in a democratic country and not be extradited to Turkey. Greece's Communist party and a small leftist opposition party have called on the government to exercise its influence on Italy to keep Ocalan there. The move has also been supported by a number of parliamentary deputies from the governing Socialist party. Earlier this month, a bloc of 109 lawmakers in the 300-member parliament issued an invitation for Ocalan to visit Greece."}
