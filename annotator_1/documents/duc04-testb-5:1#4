Prosecutor Celil Demircioglu stated that the Italian inmate is not in any life-threatening danger and that negotiations are ongoing to secure his release soon. However, the extradition process for Calascibetta has been delayed by a few days due to the situation. Demircioglu also denied reports that the Italian was being held at gunpoint. Oz, who is currently on trial for drugs-related charges, has often supported right-wing parties and ultranationalist causes."}
