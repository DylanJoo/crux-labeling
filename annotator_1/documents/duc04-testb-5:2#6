Turkey is pushing for Italy to extradite Ocalan, who leads the Kurdistan Workers' Party and is viewed as a terrorist in Turkey. Germany also has an outstanding warrant for his arrest on homicide charges. However, D'Alema is under pressure from left-wing members of his coalition to offer Ocalan political asylum, a move that would be in line with Italy's prohibition on extraditing suspects to countries with the death penalty, which Turkey still has in place."}
