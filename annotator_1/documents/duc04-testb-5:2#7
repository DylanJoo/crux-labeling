He emphasized that a committee within the Interior Ministry would assess Ocalan's eligibility for asylum, which could be granted if Ocalan's promise to renounce terrorism holds true. This decision is seen as an opportunity to find a peaceful resolution to the conflict. Thousands of Kurds demonstrated in Rome in support of Ocalan, while Turkish officials met with members of D'Alema's government to discuss the matter."}
