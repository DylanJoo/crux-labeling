Turkey is exerting pressure on Italy to extradite Ocalan, warning that granting him asylum would be tantamount to \"opening doors to terrorism.\" This comes as 1,500 Kurds gathered outside the military hospital in Rome where Ocalan is being held, demonstrating their support for the rebel leader. The Kurds, who arrived from Germany and France, are concerned that if Italy extradites Ocalan to Turkey, he will be tortured and possibly killed."}
