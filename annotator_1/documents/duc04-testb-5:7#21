Turkey has stepped up pressure on Italy to extradite Ocalan, warning that granting him asylum would be equivalent to \"opening doors to terrorism.\" Kurds in Italy, Germany, Austria, and Romania have responded with protests and hunger strikes, demonstrating their solidarity with the rebel leader. A 1,500-strong protest was held outside the military hospital in Rome, where Ocalan is believed to be held under tight security."}
