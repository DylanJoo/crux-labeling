Turkey views Ocalan as its most-wanted criminal, and Deputy Premier Bulent Ecevit has warned that Western European nations that provide asylum to Kurdish rebels will be \"taking on this great terrorism problem.\" Ecevit's comments were echoed by Turkish Defense Minister Ismet Sezgin, who suggested that Italian companies could be shut out of Turkey's defense contracts if Italy fails to extradite Ocalan."}
