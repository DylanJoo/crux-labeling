The visit was initiated by President Thomas Klestil's invitation, coinciding with Austria's European Union presidency. The Austrian government aims to open up a \"longer-term perspective\" for Turkey's EU membership, which is expected to be a key topic of discussion. Another pressing issue is the situation in Cyprus, one of the six countries engaged in formal membership talks with the European Union since November 10. The inability of Greek and Turkish Cypriots to reconcile their differences has raised concerns about Cyprus' membership chances."}
