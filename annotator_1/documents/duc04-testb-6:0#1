The agency's president, Astrid Heiberg, noted that people are being served noodles and cakes made from a mixture of soybeans, acorns, grass, and herbs, which she likened to \"cattle food.\" This mixture has led to a rise in stomach illnesses, according to doctors. Heiberg emphasized that this is a daily reality for the North Korean people, with widespread malnutrition and tuberculosis on the rise. The country's grain harvest has been severely impacted, with only 3 million tons produced, enough to meet only two-thirds of the population's needs."}
