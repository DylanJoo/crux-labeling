The agency is concerned that the harsh winter will exacerbate the existing health crisis, with doctors warning that respiratory illnesses may \"take a toll\" on the weakened population. Heiberg cited the example of a 10-bed hospital in the countryside that is only able to care for three patients at a time due to a lack of food. The Red Cross is urging the international community to take action to address the humanitarian crisis in North Korea, emphasizing that humanitarian suffering should not be allowed to become routine in any part of the world."}
