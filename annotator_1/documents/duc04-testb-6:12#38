{"id": "duc04-testb-6:12#38", "contents": "The international community has been slow to respond to North Korea's crisis, in part due to the government's hard-line policies. The United Nations has appealed for relief aid, but the latest appeal has raised less than one-third of the target. Doctors Without Borders has pulled its staff from North Korea due to concerns that aid was not reaching the most needy. Estimates suggest that 30% of North Korean children under 2 are acutely malnourished, and 67% of all children are physically stunted. Hall believes that at least 1 million people have died, and possibly as many as 3 million. The U.S. Bureau of the Census has estimated that North Korea's population has declined by 320,000 over three years, a period when it would have been expected to grow by about 925,000 people."}
