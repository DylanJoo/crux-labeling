According to U.N. experts, two-thirds of children under the age of seven are suffering from malnourishment. The economic downturn and natural disasters such as flooding and droughts have severely impacted the country's crop production and ability to import food, leading to widespread shortages. A recent survey conducted by the World Food Program, the U.N. Children's Fund, and the European Union revealed that 16 percent of children in North Korea are acutely malnourished, with a body weight that is too low for their height."}
