Children in the country's three largest cities - Pyongyang, Wonsan, and Nampo - were found to be better off, with 11 percent suffering from acute malnutrition. In contrast, boys were almost twice as badly affected as girls. The findings highlight the urgent need for continued international support to address the severe food shortages and malnutrition in North Korea."}
