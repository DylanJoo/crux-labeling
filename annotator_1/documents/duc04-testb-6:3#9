Thirty percent of 1-year-olds suffer from moderate to severe malnutrition, which can lead to impaired mental and physical development. The researchers found that available scientific data suggest that 10 years ago, malnutrition was rare in North Korea. Judit Katona-Apte, a senior program adviser for the World Food Program, stated that even if the situation improves, it is unlikely to fully recover from the current state. She emphasized that people will be small, not as well-developed, and somewhat limited in their mental capacities."}
