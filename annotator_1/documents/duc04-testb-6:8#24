{"id": "duc04-testb-6:8#24", "contents": "North Korea's harvest this year is expected to be no better than last year and could potentially be worse, according to Namanga Ngongi, deputy head of the World Food Program. The country requires a minimum of 4.5 to 5 million tons of grain to feed its 23 million people, but last year's harvest only yielded 2.8 million tons. Ngongi's assessment is based on his recent visit to North Korea, where he observed the effects of poor harvests, economic collapse, and three years of floods and drought on the country's food supply. Fertilizer and fuel shortages have further exacerbated the situation, forcing most planting and harvesting to be done by hand."}
