The government cited security concerns, including the lack of a peace treaty with South Korea, as the reason for reducing the number of counties to which the WFP has access from 171 to 145. This decision has resulted in a decrease in the number of people who can receive aid, from 6.7 million to 5.8 million. The majority of those receiving aid are children between the ages of 6 months and 6 years. Ngongi expressed concern about the situation, stating that every year it gets worse, and that the government's restrictions will only exacerbate the problem."}
