{"id": "duc04-testb-7:0#0", "contents": "White House and congressional budget negotiators are at an impasse over the 2000 census, with the White House finding itself negotiating with both House Democrats and Republicans. The sticking point is whether to use statistical sampling to supplement traditional methods of counting people. On Monday, White House negotiators, led by chief of staff Erskine Bowles, met with Democrats to discuss a deal to finance the departments of State, Justice, and Commerce, which oversees the Census Bureau, for six months. The proposal would put off the contentious issue of sampling until next March, when the Supreme Court is expected to rule on its legality. However, House Democrats are hesitant to accept the deal, arguing that even if the Supreme Court allows sampling, Republicans would be under no obligation to approve funding for a census that includes it."}
