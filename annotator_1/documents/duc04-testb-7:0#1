{"id": "duc04-testb-7:0#1", "contents": "Statistical sampling would allow the Census Bureau to estimate populations that are difficult to count, particularly in urban and rural areas where African-Americans, blacks, and Hispanics are traditionally undercounted. Democrats hope that sampling would raise the count of people living in traditionally Democratic areas, giving the party an advantage when new election district boundaries are drawn. Republicans fear this outcome and are opposed to sampling. At Monday's meeting, Democrats reminded administration officials that President Clinton had promised to veto any legislation that restricts the Census Bureau's ability to conduct an accurate census. They argue that not fully funding the census would be a restriction."}
