Many Democrats do not trust the White House on this issue, citing past experiences where they were not consulted or were cut out of agreements. At a meeting of the Democratic caucus, Rep. Carolyn Maloney briefed lawmakers on dealings with the White House and claimed that Clinton had promised to hold firm on the census, but her statement was met with laughter. Despite this, Democrats are pressing the president to include full funding for the census in the budget, along with other issues like school construction."}
