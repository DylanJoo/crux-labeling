{"id": "duc04-testb-7:11#35", "contents": "The outcome of the budget negotiations is still uncertain, with conservative Republicans threatening to withhold their support if their concerns are not addressed. If Republican leaders cannot count on their conservatives, they may need to seek support from Democrats to pass the final package. However, Democrats are also expressing concerns over some White House positions, including the census and an apparent compromise with Republicans on aid for farmers. Rep. David McIntosh, R-Ind., a leader of House conservatives, believes that Republican leaders are ceding too quickly to the White House and that the president is controlling the situation. Despite this, McIntosh suggests that he could vote for a final accord, but only if he sees a better deal than what is currently being proposed."}
