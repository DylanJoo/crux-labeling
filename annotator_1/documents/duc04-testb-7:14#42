{"id": "duc04-testb-7:14#42", "contents": "For the first time in decades, Congress and the White House negotiated tax and spending legislation this year with the budget in surplus. The result was chaos. The lawmakers were never able to agree on a budget resolution - the framework into which all the tax and spending bills are supposed to fit. This had not happened since congressional budget procedures were established in 1974. Then, without the discipline of such an overall plan, the Senate and the House could not pass eight of the 13 spending bills needed to keep the government running. So the lawmakers had to stay in session more than a week longer than they had hoped. Finally, they lumped all eight bills together this week and announced an agreement. But the only way they could get this far was to resort to gimmicks."}
