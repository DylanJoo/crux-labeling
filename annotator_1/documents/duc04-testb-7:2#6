{"id": "duc04-testb-7:2#6", "contents": "As the budget package approaches the House floor, concerns are growing among conservative Republicans over the emerging shape of the final agreement. They are particularly concerned about elements dealing with family planning and emergency spending, which they believe will break the limits set in last year's balanced-budget agreement. The administration claims that the emergency spending will be offset by corresponding cuts elsewhere in the budget, but conservatives argue that it will come from raiding the surplus. If Republican leaders are unable to secure the support of their conservative members, they may need to rely on Democrats to pass the final package."}
