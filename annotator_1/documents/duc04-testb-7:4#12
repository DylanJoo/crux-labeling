However, many conservatives are expected to vote in favor of the $500 billion package due to its increase in defense spending and aid to farmers. The deal, hailed by President Clinton and Republican leaders, is still being written and faces disputes over various provisions, including a proposal to create \"peanut-free\" zones on airlines. The final document is expected to exceed 3,000 pages, and Congress has given itself until midnight Tuesday to vote on the bill."}
