{"id": "duc04-testb-7:4#13", "contents": "The spending agreement was reached between President Clinton and Republican leaders, but the actual document is still being crafted by the chairmen of the spending committees and their aides. The process has been delayed, and the bill is nowhere near completion. Only a handful of top-level bargainers, including House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, were involved in the final deal, while committee chairmen and heads of the appropriation committees were excluded. The delay has raised concerns among conservatives that more provisions will be added to the bill, further expanding its scope."}
