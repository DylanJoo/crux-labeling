The 30-mile road would connect the isolated village of King Cove to a long-range air strip in Cold Bay, providing residents with a safer and more reliable way to access medical evacuation to Anchorage. Currently, residents must use unreliable air and boat service, often risking dangerous winds and seas. The road's backers argue that this is a necessary measure to ensure the health and safety of the village's 700 residents."}
