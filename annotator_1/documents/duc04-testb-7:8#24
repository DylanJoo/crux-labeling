{"id": "duc04-testb-7:8#24", "contents": "House and Senate negotiators have agreed to require most federal health plans to cover prescription contraceptives for women, marking a significant victory for abortion rights advocates on Capitol Hill. This measure would affect 1.2 million female federal employees of child-bearing age, who are currently covered by federal health plans that only cover these methods in 19% of cases. The approved methods of contraception include birth control pills, diaphragms, inter-uterine devices, Norplant, and Depo-Provera, all of which have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration."}
