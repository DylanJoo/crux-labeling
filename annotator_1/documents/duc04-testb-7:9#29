{"id": "duc04-testb-7:9#29", "contents": "Despite concerns over the bill's size and the lack of a serious tax cut, many conservatives are expected to support the bill. Rep. Mark Souder, R-Ind., stated that while he is unhappy with the lack of tax cuts and excessive spending, he will \"hold the nose and vote yes\" due to the increase in defense spending and aid to farmers. Souder noted that the compromise is a mixed bag for conservatives, with some members prioritizing different aspects of the bill. The elections on November 3 may also play a role in the bill's passage, as voters may put pressure on members to support or oppose the bill once its contents are publicly revealed."}
