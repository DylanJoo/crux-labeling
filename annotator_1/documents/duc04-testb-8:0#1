However, Hamas has carried out more than a dozen suicide bombings in Israel in an attempt to bring peace talks with Israel to a halt. On Monday, Clinton and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat are to address members of the Palestine National Council and delegates from other groups, at the Shawa Cultural Center in Gaza City. Traffic near the Shawa Center still flowed normally Tuesday, but plainclothes security as well as uniformed officers with M-17 and AK-47 assault rifles began patrolling in the vicinity."}
