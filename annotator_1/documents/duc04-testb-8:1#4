However, Israel has rejected this proposal, with Cabinet Secretary Danny Naveh stating that \"Israel has not been offered such a compromise and there will not be such a compromise.\" The Palestinians have accused Israel of breaking a promise to release prisoners held for anti-Israeli activities, while Israel claims it never made such a pledge. The prisoner issue has become a point of contention between the two sides, with the Palestinians demanding the release of 750 prisoners by the end of January."}
