This move comes after Israel demanded the revocation of these clauses during U.S.-brokered negotiations last month, which led to the latest land-for-peace deal between Israel and the Palestinians. As part of this settlement, Clinton agreed to visit territory controlled by the Palestinian Authority to speak at the meeting of the Palestinian National Council."}
