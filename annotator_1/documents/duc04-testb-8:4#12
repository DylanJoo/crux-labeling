The Palestinians have warned of possible violence if Israel continues to expand settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, where they hope to establish a state. Ahmed Qureia, speaker of the Palestinian parliament, stated that \"if settlement activity continues, then all means of resistance are open.\" Since the signing of the land-for-security accord, Jewish settlers have accelerated the establishment of makeshift communities on West Bank hilltops, in an attempt to keep the land from being turned over to the Palestinians."}
