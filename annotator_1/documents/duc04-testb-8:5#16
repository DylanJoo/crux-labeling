In his remarks at the airport arrival ceremony on Saturday night, he emphasized the importance of implementing the Wye River accord, saying that \"peace is not simply an option among many but the only choice that can avert still more years of bloodshed, apprehension and sorrow.\" Netanyahu, however, was more critical of the Palestinians, accusing them of violating their commitments and inciting violence.
