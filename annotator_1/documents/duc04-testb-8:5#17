The president's trip to Gaza was seen as a boost for Palestinian statehood, with some interpreting it as de facto recognition of a Palestinian state. Clinton's address to the Palestinian National Council was expected to be a significant moment in the peace process, as the Palestinians seek to establish a sovereign state. The visit was also marked by violence, with Palestinian stone throwers clashing with Israeli troops and an Israeli high school student being stabbed by a Palestinian teenager."}
