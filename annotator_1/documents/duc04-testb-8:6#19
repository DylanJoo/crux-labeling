{"id": "duc04-testb-8:6#19", "contents": "The scene at the Erekat home, in the Arab village of Abu Dis on Jerusalem's eastern outskirts, drives home a central truth about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict: on both sides of the divide, the political is also deeply personal. And that inescapability goes to the heart of the quarrel's intractability. In the glare of world attention, it is easy to forget that there are fewer people living in Israel and the Palestinian lands combined than there are in New York City. In the small and jostling confines of what few here choose to call the Holy Land, the conflict touches all. Everyone has a stake in it. Israelis fret daily over soldier sons on dangerous patrol in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, or shudder when they pass a sidewalk cafe once ripped by an Islamic militant's suicide bomb."}
