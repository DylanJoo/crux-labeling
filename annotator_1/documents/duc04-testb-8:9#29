Israel insists a vote be taken by a show of hands, while the Palestinians say only approval by acclamation is required. Netanyahu said Thursday he will not settle for anything less than a vote, even if Clinton declares the PNC session a success without it. The Palestinians, meanwhile, pressed ahead with implementing the accord, with 98 members of the 124-member Palestinian Central Council meeting to hold a vote on whether to approve the Arafat letter concerning the PLO charter."}
