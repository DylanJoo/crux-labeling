The Russian-built Zarya control module and the American-made Unity chamber fit together perfectly, marking a historic moment in the construction of the space station. Commander Robert Cabana announced the capture of Zarya, and Mission Control congratulated the crew on their achievement. The 240-mile-high construction job began with Nancy Currie's capture of Zarya using the shuttle robot arm, followed by the challenging task of stacking the two giant cylinders in the cargo bay."}
