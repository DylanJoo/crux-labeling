{"id": "duc04-testb-9:0#1", "contents": "The two station pieces are enormous, measuring 77 feet from tip to tip and weighing a combined 70,000 pounds. To align them, Currie relied on a computerized vision system and camera views, rather than direct line of sight. This \"blind\" docking had never been attempted before. After careful positioning, Cabana fired Endeavour's thrusters, raising the shuttle and Unity enough for the docking mechanisms to snap together. The union is intended to last the station's 15-year or more lifetime and sets the stage for a spacewalk by two astronauts on Monday to attach electrical connectors and cables between the two components."}
