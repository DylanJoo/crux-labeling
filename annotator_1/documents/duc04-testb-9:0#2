The joined modules will be released from Endeavour once all the work is completed, and NASA estimates that 43 more launches and 159 more spacewalks will be needed to assemble the entire orbiting complex. The completed space station will have a mass of 1 million pounds, be longer than a football field, and house up to seven astronauts and cosmonauts. The Endeavour's 12-day flight includes three spacewalks to install handrails and other tools for future crews, marking an important step towards the completion of the space station."}
