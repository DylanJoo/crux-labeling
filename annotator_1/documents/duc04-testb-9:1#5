The union is intended to last the station's 15-year or more lifetime. The space station will eventually be assembled through 43 more launches and 159 more spacewalks, and will have a mass of 1 million pounds, be longer than a football field, and house up to seven astronauts and cosmonauts. The Endeavour's mission is a crucial step towards the completion of the orbiting complex, and the astronauts' work will pave the way for future crews to continue the construction process."}
