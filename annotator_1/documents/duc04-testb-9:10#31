The U.S. costs for construction were $24 billion, and for operations through the year 2012 were $10.4 billion, totaling $34.4 billion. However, many experts outside the agency consider this figure to be an underestimation, as it does not account for the billions of dollars spent on early development work and the cost of numerous shuttle flights, which can cost around $800 million each."}
