The Russian-built Zarya control module and the American-made Unity chamber were joined together, marking a historic moment in the construction of the orbiting complex. The 240-mile-high construction job began with Nancy Currie's capture of Zarya using the shuttle robot arm. The two station pieces are massive, with a combined mass of 70,000 pounds, and Currie had to rely on a computerized vision system and camera views to align them."}
