{"id": "duc04-testb-9:11#33", "contents": "The joining of Zarya and Unity was a complex process, requiring precise alignment and a brief burst of Endeavour's thrusters to bring the two components together. The docking mechanisms on the two station components snapped together, securing the union that is intended to last the station's 15-year or more lifetime. However, the docking ring between them would not retract properly, and Mission Control had to troubleshoot the issue. The problem was eventually resolved by releasing the robot arm's hold on the docked Zarya. The successful docking set the stage for a spacewalk by two astronauts on Monday to attach electrical connectors and cables between the two components."}
