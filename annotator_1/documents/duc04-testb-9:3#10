Mission Control ordered the pilots to fire the shuttle thrusters to put an extra three miles between Endeavour and the space junk, putting Endeavour a total of five miles from the orbiting debris. The smaller gap would have been \"probably a little too close for comfort,\" Mission Control said. The bigger worry, by far, was over Endeavour's pursuit and capture of Zarya, and its coupling with Unity."}
