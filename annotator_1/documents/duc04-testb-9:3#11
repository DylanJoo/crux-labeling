It will provide all the necessary electricity and steering for the fledgling space station until a permanent control module can be launched next summer. The 36-foot, 25,000-pound Unity will serve as a connecting passageway, or vestibule, for future modules. NASA estimates 43 more launches and 159 more spacewalks will be needed after this mission to assemble the entire orbiting complex."}
