{"id": "duc04-testb-9:4#13", "contents": "The master alarm blared and red lights flashed just before the shuttle was to lift off early Thursday, forcing a delay. The problem was confined to one of Endeavour's three hydraulic pressure units, which dropped just long enough to trigger the alarm, then returned to normal. NASA engineers spent the day examining the problem, but found nothing wrong with any of the systems and were confident it would not reoccur. The one-day delay cost NASA about $600,000, mostly in fuel and overtime pay."}
