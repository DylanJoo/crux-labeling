Two spacewalkers will then hook up all the electrical connections and cables between the two cylinders, and attach handrails and tools for future crews. The mission is already a year late due to a cash crunch in Russia, one of NASA's partners in building the international space station. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and other dignitaries from around the world gathered to see Endeavour and its crew off, highlighting the international cooperation on the venture."}
