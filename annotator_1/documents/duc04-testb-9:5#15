Another attempt for Endeavour and its crew of six astronauts is scheduled for Friday at 3:36 a.m. This was the first time in three years, and 19 flights, that a shuttle countdown had been stopped after the spaceship was fueled and the crew aboard the craft and ready to go. The uncommon delay prompted frowns and furrowed brows here, although officials stressed that it was entirely warranted."}
