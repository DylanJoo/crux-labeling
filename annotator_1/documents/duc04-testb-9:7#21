The Russian-built Zarya control module and the American-made Unity chamber were joined together, marking a historic moment in the construction of the orbiting complex. The 240-mile-high construction job began with Nancy Currie's capture of Zarya using the shuttle's robot arm, followed by the stacking of the two giant cylinders in the cargo bay."}
