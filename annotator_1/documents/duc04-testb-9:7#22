{"id": "duc04-testb-9:7#22", "contents": "The joining of Zarya and Unity was a complex process, requiring the use of a computerized vision system and camera views due to the massive size of the two components. The 77-foot-long and 70,000-pound combined mass of the two station pieces made direct line of sight impossible. After positioning Zarya above Unity, commander Robert Cabana fired the shuttle's thrusters, allowing the docking mechanisms to snap together. The union is intended to last the station's 15-year or more lifetime and sets the stage for a spacewalk by two astronauts on Monday to attach electrical connectors and cables between the two components."}
