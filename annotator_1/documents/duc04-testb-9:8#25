Wielding tools hundreds of miles above Earth, working methodically in the cold void, the astronauts will be starting a five-year assembly that is likely to make the construction of the Pyramids and the great cathedrals look like child's play. Construction of the station, which will be a research facility, will require an estimated 160 space walks, which, for safety reasons, will always be done by two people. When complete, the international space station, dominated by solar power arrays, will cover an area equal to that of two football fields."}
