Jerry Ross and Dr. James Newman, will hook up electrical connections and data cables between the units, attach antennas, and install tools and handrails for future visitors. The crew will then enter the new station through a connecting tunnel and docking system, installing portable fans and lights. The astronauts will also prepare for the arrival of the next major element, the first one built and financed by Russia, which is scheduled to arrive in 1999. The crew will bring Endeavour back to the Kennedy Space Center on December 16, marking the end of the STS-88 mission."}
