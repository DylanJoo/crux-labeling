At issue were provisions that included requiring Federal Health Insurance providers to provide contraceptives to women as Well as a provision to build a road across a wildlife preserve in Alaska. The contraceptive issue faced an uncertain future while Clinton likely will veto the road. There is disagreement also on how to spend the funding on education. This year's budget discussions also have been hampered because it is the first time since budget procedures were established in 1974 that there has been a surplus, preventing agreement on a budget resolution. Whether to use the 1st surplus in decades for a tax cut, to pay off the national debt, or for new initiatives made the 1998 federal budget negotiations chaotic. The Oct 1 start of the fiscal year was extended 5 times. Major issues were census statistical sampling, federal health plan coverage of contraceptives regardless of religious affiliation, and school aid decisions by the federal gov't or local jurisdictions. Other issues included a Federal Election Commission provision, a road through an Alaskan wildlife refuge, and an airline peanut ban. Committees crafted the budget document after broad agreement was reached when 8 bills were lumped together. In 1998, for the first time in decades, the US budget negotiators faced a surplus. Both sides said this was harder than a deficit situation, but they finally spent $1.7 trillion. The last seven spending bills were the most difficult and finally were merged into one package. Controversial issues included health insurance paying for contraception, control of new education allocations, an Alaskan wilderness road, whether the 2000 census would include statistical sampling, and establishing an emergency fund. Conservatives felt the results favored the liberals, but both sides were satisfied and glad to finish before Election Day and avoid a government shutdown. After several deadline extensions, Congressional leaders and the White House agreed on an omnibus spending package, the final portion of the $1.7 trillion budget. It includes more money for education and defense, business tax breaks, and farm aid, as well as funds for Colombia to use in drug interdiction. To offset the new spending, the surplus will be tapped for $20 billion, to the ire of conservatives. This year, without the common goal of reducing the deficit, reaching agreement was very difficult. Policy provisions involving the 2000 census, contraception, and the Alaskan wilderness were also tied to the spending package and were hotly debated.", "response": "The 1998 federal budget negotiations were a contentious and complex process that ultimately resulted in a modest agreement. Close congressional negotiators led by House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan, R-Wis., and Senate Budget Committee Chairwoman Patty Murray, D-Wash., worked tirelessly to reach a consensus on the budget. The negotiations were delayed due to several issues, including the financing for the International Monetary Fund and the implementation of spending cuts. Despite these challenges, the two sides were able to find common ground and agree on a budget deal that would restore about $63 billion in automatic spending cuts. The agreement, which was praised by President Obama as \"a good first step,\" sets spending levels for the federal government for two years and partially replaces unpopular spending cuts with other savings. The deal, while modest in scope, amounts to a cease-fire in the budget wars that have debilitated Washington since 2011. This agreement gives lawmakers breathing room to try to address the real drivers of federal spending, such as health care and entitlement programs like Medicare and Social Security. The budget negotiations serve as a reminder that working in divided government is not new and that bipartisan compromise is possible. As recently as 1995, President Bill Clinton worked with House Speaker Newt Gingrich to reach a bipartisan compromise over the debt ceiling and to end a government shutdown. The 1998 budget agreement was a significant achievement, marking the first time since the Korean War that the United States would have two consecutive years of reduced nominal spending. The agreement demonstrates that even in the face of adversity, lawmakers can work together to find solutions and move the country forward.

The visit was aimed at providing impetus to the U.S.-brokered peace accords, but it ultimately became a polarizing force. The Palestinians saw the visit as a boost to their sovereignty hopes, while Israel was concerned about the implications of Clinton's planned visit to Gaza. Arafat adviser Ahmed Tibi stated that the invitation came from Israel and was \"warmly welcomed\" by the Palestinians.\n\nThe visit sparked controversy within Israel, with some ministers questioning the decision to invite Clinton to the Gaza Strip. The United States had stated that the visit was not intended as an endorsement of Palestinian statehood. Clinton was set to travel to Gaza next month to address Palestinian leaders at a historic meeting aimed at formally revoking anti-Israel clauses in the 1964 Palestinian charter. As part of this settlement, Clinton agreed to visit territory controlled by the Palestinian Authority to speak at the meeting of the Palestinian National Council.\n\nThe meeting in Gaza on December 14 was expected to be contentious, with many prominent Palestinians criticizing the Wye agreement for allowing the Israeli government to backtrack on promises made to the Palestinians in their 1994 peace settlement. Clinton's visit was seen as a crucial step in the Middle East peace process, and he was expected to speak to the Israeli and Palestinian people about the importance of the Wye agreement and the need to continue supporting the peace process. The White House had released a schedule for Clinton's four-day trip, which included meetings with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader.\n\nThe visit was met with mixed reactions from Hamas, Israel, and Palestine. Hamas was critical of the visit, while Israel was concerned about the implications of Clinton's planned visit to Gaza. The Palestinians, on the other hand, saw the visit as a boost to their sovereignty hopes. The violence in the region raised concern that Clinton's visit was fomenting more unrest rather than calming the already tense situation. Israeli hard-liners, including Cabinet ministers, had said Clinton's visit was conferring statehood status on the Palestinian areas. The most problematic moment of the Clinton visit was his address Monday to the Palestine National Council, the Palestinians' parliament-in-exile, and other Palestinian groups, in Gaza City. Overall, the visit marked a critical moment in the peace process, with President Clinton and Prime Minister Netanyahu's political positions being put to the test.

Although delayed for a day, U.S. plans to launch the space shuttle Endeavour carrying the U.S. module Unity and six astronauts were carried out on Dec. 4. The astronauts' job was to connect Unity with the already-orbiting Zarya as the first step in assembling 100 major components of the planned space station. Using the shuttle's 50-foot robot arm, the two modules were joined setting the stage for a spacewalk by two astronauts the next day to attach electrical connectors and cables. The International Space Station when completed will have a million pound mass and be longer than a football field. It will house up to seven space explorers. The initial assembly of space station components involves linking the US Unity, carried into space by the shuttle Endeavour, with the Russian Zarya. The Russians had asked for a different launch profile in order to be able to transfer equipment from its MIR station, but that was not possible. Endeavour astronauts successfully completed the complicated maneuvers to join the two space objects. NASA estimates that 43 more launches will be required to completely assemble the 16-nation space station. On Friday the shuttle Endeavor carried six astronauts into orbit to start building an international space station. The launch occurred after Russia and U.S. officials agreed not to delay the flight in order to orbit closer to MIR, and after a last-minute alarm forced a postponement. On Sunday astronauts joining the Russian-made Zarya control module cylinder with the American-made module to form a 70,000 pounds mass 77 feet long. NASA estimates 43 more launches and 159 more space walks are needed to assemble the complex. When completed the 16-nation space station will be longer than a football field. It will be used to study adaptation to space flight. Russia and NASA jointly decided against a Russian cost-cutting proposal to orbit the 2nd space station, a 16-country cooperative project, closer to Mir, citing complexity, risk, and bad sun angles. After 5 years of assembly, the research station will house 7 people. A 12-day shuttle mission will attach the US Unity module to the Russian Zarya, already in orbit. Thursday's launch was delayed by a pressure drop. A 2nd attempt Friday was perfect. Unity was attached to Zarya in a blind docking using cameras and computer images. Electrical and cable connections come next. Unity will serve as a passageway for future modules. Two Zarya antennas failed to deploy.", "response": "The International Space Station (ISS) was launched with the successful deployment of the first module, Zarya, which was launched from the Baikonur cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on a Russian Proton booster rocket. Zarya, a crucial component of the station, was built in Russia with $240 million from the United States and is designed to be joined by other modules in space. The first American module, a docking hub called Unity, was launched on the space shuttle Endeavour, which carried out a 12-day flight including three spacewalks to install handrails and other tools for future crews. The successful docking of Zarya and Unity marked a significant milestone in the assembly of the ISS, demonstrating the capabilities of the shuttle's robot arm and the precision of the astronauts.\n\nThe assembly process of the ISS involved 43 more flights by American and Russian rockets carrying over 100 parts to be assembled in space. NASA estimates that 159 more spacewalks will be needed to assemble the entire orbiting complex, which will have a mass of 1 million pounds, be longer than a football field, and house up to seven astronauts and cosmonauts. The ISS was built by a partnership of 16 nations, with the space station including several large modules, each launched separately and connected in space by astronauts. Notable moments in the station's history include the first assembly sequence in 1998, the installation of solar arrays in 2000, and the delivery of the Japanese-built Kibo lab in 2008.\n\nThe assembly of the ISS required significant resources and time, with NASA estimating that 43 more launches and 159 more spacewalks will be needed to complete the space station. The space station has been in operation since 1998, with the last space shuttle to visit the station being Atlantis in 2011. Since the U.S. shuttle program ended in 2011, all crew members are ferried to and from the space station on Russian rockets. The ISS is the largest orbital laboratory in history, with a complex assembly process that involved the collaboration of multiple nations and organizations.\n\nIn conclusion, the launch and initial assembly of the International Space Station was a complex and significant undertaking that required the collaboration of multiple nations and organizations. The assembly process involved the deployment of several modules, including Zarya and Unity, and required significant resources and time. The ISS is now operational and continues to be a vital hub for scientific research and exploration in space.  Word Count: 499.

Thai police cleared the streets of beggars and criminals, and athletes were disciplined to avoid Bangkok's night life. China's recall of four soccer players from Europe is testimony of the importance of the games. The Asian Games scheduled for Bangkok Dec. 6-20, 1998 were never a sure thing. Thailand was in economic doldrums and there was question whether the sports complex for the games would be completed in time. By late October, however, it was clear the games could take place. Thai police rounded up beggars who might intimidate spectators, but then in late November Saudi Arabia withdrew its teams and there was concern that athletes might be tempted by Bangkok's nightlife and the availability of Viagra. But on Dec. 6 the games opened as scheduled as 6,000 athletes from 41 nations competed, including a heated snooker match between India and Pakistan. Despite economic problems and threats from the Asian Olympic Committee that it would move the games, Thailand was able to meet construction deadlines and open the 13th annual Asian Games to participants from 43 countries. The games have not been without controversy. In a surprise move, Saudi Arabia pulled its athletes from the games, probably in reprisal for a jewel theft and the murder of three of its diplomats. There was speculation that the Saudis would send a ceremonial delegation. National rivalries also were Apparent in a snooker game between India and Pakistan when an argument Arose following a disputed call. Bangkok prepared for the 6000 athletes from 41 nations to compete in the Asian Games.

Thailand had won the host rights in 1995, but faced setbacks that led the Olympic Council of Asia to threaten to move the games to another country late last year. However, with the successful tour of the country's nearly complete facilities to a delegation of heads of organizing committees from 43 competing nations, doubts were alleviated, and the games were able to proceed as planned.\n\nThe opening ceremony, held on Sunday night, was a grand spectacle, featuring 7,614 performers and a theme of \"Friendship Beyond Frontiers.\" The ceremony began with a torch relay led by Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai, followed by a three-hour show that included a martial arts display celebrating Asian unity and a display of fireworks and searchlights. The ceremony also included the introduction of the games' mascot, \"Chai-yo,\" by hundreds of primary school students.\n\nDespite the resolution of the liquidity issue, the preparations for the games had been marred by controversy. The decision to award the contract for the sports complex was met with criticism, and the country's worst economic downturn in decades raised doubts over Thailand's ability to host the games. However, organizers of the Asian Games dismissed reports suggesting that the sports complex would not be completed on time, stating that construction was 95 percent complete and expected to be finished by the end of the month.\n\nThe games were also affected by the sudden withdrawal of Saudi Arabia, which left organizers scrambling to adjust schedules and raised concerns about the strained relations between Thailand and Saudi Arabia. However, the Thai deputy prime minister and president of the Bangkok Asian Games Organizing Committee, Bhichai Rattakul, requested the Foreign Ministry to urge the Saudi government to reconsider its decision to withdraw its 105-strong team.\n\nThe Asian Games were a proving ground for the 2000 Olympics in Sydney, Australia, and many countries had sent reduced teams due to the Asian crisis. China's deputy head of delegation, Li Furong, stated that the main target was the 2000 Olympics, and the games were not just about winning gold medals, but about achieving world standards. The games featured 377 gold medals in 36 sports, including Asian specialties such as kabaddi and sepak takraw.\n\nIn addition to the games themselves, the event also focused on creating a safer environment for visitors and participants. Police were focusing on addressing issues such as foreign criminal gangs and beggars, with the aim of ensuring a successful and secure event.\n\nFinally, the games also featured a unique aspect - the introduction of horses from abroad, which were required to undergo screening for various diseases before arriving in Thailand. Unfortunately for the Iranian team, they were the only country that failed to meet these requirements, and their horses were unable to compete due to the potential risk to the health of other horses.\n\nIn conclusion, the 1998 Asian Games in Bangkok, Thailand, were a significant event that showcased the country's resilience in the face of economic crisis. Despite the challenges and controversies that surrounded the preparations, the games were able to proceed as planned, and the event was a success in terms of creating a safer environment for visitors and participants. The games also featured a unique aspect, with the introduction of horses from abroad and the focus on achieving world standards for the 2000 Olympics. Overall, the 1998 Asian Games were a memorable event that left a lasting impact on the country and its people.", "k": 10}

Three prominent leaders of the China Democratic Party were put to trial and sentenced to 11-, 12- and 13-year prison terms. Germany and the U.S. condemned the arrests. A labor rights activist was released and exiled to the U.S. to blunt any opposition to Communist rule. U.S. policy to encourage trade and diplomacy in hope of democratic reforms evidences failure, but the U.S. is continuing its policy of encouragement. Friends of jailed dissidents state that they will continue to campaign for change. The US trade-driven policy of expanded ties encouraging Chinese democracy is questioned. China signed rights treaties and dissidents used new laws to set up China Democracy Party, but China violates the new laws by persecuting dissidents. It regularly frees activists from prison then exiles them so they lose local influence. It arrested an activist trying to register a rights monitoring group. CP leader Jiang's hard-line speech and publicity for activists sentenced to long prison terms signals a renewed Chinese crackdown. A rights activist expected to be sacrificed in the cause of democracy. Germany called China's sentencing of dissidents unacceptable. After 2 years of wooing the West by signing international accords, apparently relaxing controls on free speech, and releasing and exiling three dissenters, China cracked down against political dissent in Dec 1998. Leaders of the China Democracy Party (CDP) were arrested and three were sentenced to jail terms of 11 to 13 years. The West, including the US, UK and Germany, reacted strongly. Clinton's China policy of engagement was questioned. China's Jiang Zemin stated economic reform is not a prelude to democracy and vowed to crush any challenges to the Communist Party or \"social stability\". The CDP vowed to keep working, as more leaders awaited arrest. Xu Wenli, Wang Youchai, and Qin Yongmin, leading dissidents and prominent members of the China Democracy Party, were found guilty of subversion and sentenced to 13, 11, and 12 years in prison, respectively. Soon after the sentencing, China's president, Jiang Zemin, delivered speeches in which he asserted that Western political system must not be adopted and vowed to crush challenges to Communist Party rule.

The imprisonment of Liu Xiaobo, a Nobel Peace Prize laureate, has been widely condemned by the international community, with U.N. human rights experts labeling his imprisonment as a severe violation of human rights. The Chinese government's actions have been seen as a crackdown on dissent and a suppression of fundamental human rights, with many calling for Liu Xiaobo's release and an end to China's authoritarian rule. Despite China's signing of several key U.N. treaties on civil and political rights, including one in October that guarantees freedom of expression and freedom of association, the government's actions suggest a continued disregard for these principles. The international community has condemned the arrests of dissidents, with the United States expressing its concerns to the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs and urging the immediate release of Xu and Qin. However, China has maintained that its actions are in line with its international obligations, citing its support for human rights treaties as evidence. The treatment of journalists, including Gao Yu, Liu Xiaobo, and Liu Jingsheng, who were imprisoned for attempting to practice their profession, has also been widely criticized. Thousands of political prisoners are believed to remain in Chinese prisons, labor camps, or detention centers, highlighting the need for the Chinese government to take concrete steps to improve its human rights record. The case of Liu Nianchun, who was imprisoned three times in the past 17 years and subjected to harsh treatment, including beatings and confinement, is a sad illustration of the Chinese government's treatment of dissidents. Human rights groups have criticized the Chinese government's tactics, saying that forcing dissidents into exile is a form of human rights violation and persecution.

The Lockerbie bombing, which resulted in the deaths of 270 people, remains one of the deadliest terrorist attacks in history.\n\nThe U.N. has imposed economic sanctions on Libya since 1992 in response to its refusal to extradite the suspects. These sanctions have had a significant impact on Libya's economy, and Annan's efforts aim to find a solution that would allow the suspects to be tried in a neutral venue, thereby lifting the sanctions and normalizing relations between Libya and the rest of the world.

Ecevit, a former prime minister, was asked to form a new government. He was unable to win the support of Ciller for a secular coalition. Refusing any alliance with the Islamic Virtue Party, Ecevit turned to President Demirel to find another solution. Demirel was expected to turn to a widely trusted lawmaker to form Turkey's next government. New premier-designate Erez got backing from 2 key secular parties as he tried to form a broad-based secular coalition that would include some from the Virtue Party. Following charges that he interfered in a privatization contract and helped a businessman with mob ties, Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz was forced to resign. President Demeril asked Bulent Ecevit, former three-time prime minister from the 1970s and champion of Turkish Cypriot rights, to form a new government. After three weeks, Ecevit was unable to secure the support of the Center-Right Party. At issue was the participation of the Islamic Virtue Part in the secular government, Ecevit returned his mandate and Demeril named Valim Erez as prime minister designate. Erez was in talks with the Virtue Party over possible cabinet seats. Turkish PM Yilmaz was forced to step down due to mob ties and claims of state bank privatization tampering. President Demirel asked highly respected 3-time former PM Bulent Ecevit to form a new majority government. A split between parliament's center left and right is longstanding. Ecevit distrusted Yilmaz and Ciller but brought in Yilmaz's party and wooed Ciller's. She wouldn't join unless Islamic Virtue were included, which the secular parties resisted. After a 3-week effort, Ecevit gave up rather than include Virtue. Yalim Erez tried next and won the backing of 2 key secular parties.

Longtime politician and three-time prime minister, Ecevit, tried for two weeks to form a coalition, which would satisfy the staunchly secular military. He failed when he could not get the support of both center-right parties. The president then asked a member of Parliament to form an interim coalition government to serve until the April election. Erez attained center-right support if he sticks to secular principles, but he may be forced to give some Cabinet seats to the Islamic Virtue Party.", "response": "The current political situation in Turkey is marked by division and instability. As stated in, the parliament is deeply divided between its center-left and center-right parties, with longstanding animosity between them. This division has been exacerbated by the collapse of the previous government, led by Yilmaz, in November amid allegations of ties to organized crime and interference with the state bank's sale. By tradition, Demirel should have asked the leader of Parliament's largest party to form a new government, but he broke with custom to prevent the Islamic-oriented Virtue Party from coming to power. This move was motivated by the Turkish military's opposition to an Islamic-led government, as stated in, which has historically pressured governments that fail to adhere to the country's secular traditions.\n\nThe current government, led by Erdogan, is trying to contain the political fallout from the corruption inquiry, as mentioned in. The mass arrests carried out as part of this inquiry have been widely criticized, with many believing that they reflect a feud within the ruling AK Party. The implications of this development for regional stability and global politics will be closely watched, particularly in light of Turkey's ongoing involvement in the Syrian conflict, as stated in. The new political system is expected to provide the president with greater flexibility to pursue his foreign policy goals, which may have significant implications for the country's relations with its neighbors.\n\nThe current government has been accused of restricting women's rights, including their mobility and freedom to travel, as stated in. The requirement for guardian permission for women to engage in certain activities has been a point of contention, with many calling for its abolition. The scandal surrounding Yilmaz's government has also implicated other government officials, including State Minister Eyup Asik, who resigned last month after allegations surfaced of his close ties to Cakici, as mentioned in. The controversy has dealt a significant blow to Yilmaz's government, with opposition parties calling for his resignation and an investigation into the allegations.\n\nOverall, the current political situation in Turkey is characterized by division, instability, and controversy. The implications of the new political system for the country's future are unclear, but it is likely to have significant effects on regional stability and global politics.

The remark fit Sharon's long history of unyielding bellicosity towards Palestine. When he was appointed some thought that Netanyahu was placating Israel's far right wing while striving for peace. Others saw it as a move to scuttle the peace effort. Arab commentary deemed the appointment \"tantamount to disaster\" and \"the bullet of mercy\" to the peace process. Peace talks in the U.S. were in the offing with the outcome in doubt. Appointment of Ariel Sharon as Foreign Minister by PM Netanyahu does not bode well for the peace process. His appointment is surprising in that the two have differed on withdrawal from Palestinian territory and is seen as an effort to placate the right. Sharon, 70, is an unapologetic warrior on the battlefield and in partisan politics. He brings heavy baggage: right-wing intransigence and responsibility for failing to prevent the killings of 460 unarmed Palestinians in refugee camps during the Lebanon incursion. Sharon has said that he will not shake Arafat's hand and his appointment is seen as a \"bullet of mercy\" for the Middle East peace process. Ariel Sharon was named Israeli foreign minister just weeks before a scheduled peace summit in the US, aimed at negotiating an Israeli withdrawal from 13% of the West Bank. Arabs reacted strongly and said the hard-line, right-wing, warrior and former defense minister would kill any progress for a settlement in the mid-East. Many blame Sharon for a 1982 massacre of Palestinian civilians at refugee camps in Lebanon. Others believed his appointment was an effort to placate the far right and gain their support for the Netanyahu government and the concessions necessary for the peace process. Sharon vowed not to shake Yasser Arafat's hand. In a move widely viewed as an effort to placate the far right as he moves to withdraw from more West Bank land, Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu named hardliner Ariel Sharon foreign minister and chief peace negotiator. Sharon, a military leader with legendary victories in the 1967 and 1973 Mideast wars, is infamous in the Arab world as the defense minister in the 1982 invasion of Lebanon during which Lebanese Christian militiamen, Israeli allies, slaughtered hundreds of unarmed Palestinians. His appointment as lead negotiator was denounced as a \"disaster\" in the Lebanese press and \"a bullet of mercy to the peace process\" in a Syrian paper.", "response": "The appointment of Ariel Sharon as Foreign Minister by Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu in 1998 had significant implications for the Middle East peace process. Sharon's hardline stance was likely to exacerbate tensions and hinder progress in negotiations with the Palestinians, as seen in his past actions, particularly his role in Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon. The Syrian-Israeli peace talks, which had broken off over two years ago, were unlikely to resume anytime soon, while Lebanon's peace talks with Israel had also been suspended pending progress in Syrian-Israeli negotiations. The international community would be watching closely to see how Sharon's appointment affected the already fragile peace process. \n\nSaeb Erekat, a lead negotiator for the Palestinians, viewed the appointment as a sign that Netanyahu was prioritizing his relationship with the right-wing over the peace process. Erekat believed that Netanyahu was trying to \"make peace with the right wing at the expense of making peace with us.\" This move was seen as a clear message from Netanyahu that Israel would not change its anti-peace stance. The Arab community and other parties involved in the peace process were also critical of Sharon's appointment, citing his past actions and indirect responsibility for the massacre of hundreds of Palestinian refugees. \n\nThe appointment of Sharon as foreign minister was described as \"the bullet of mercy\" for the Middle East peace process by an official Syrian newspaper, Tishrin. This description implied that it would bring an end to the stalled negotiations, raising concerns about Israel's commitment to the peace process. The Arab world viewed Sharon as a hard-liner who was unlikely to make concessions, and his appointment was seen as a clear indication of Netanyahu's intentions. Overall, the appointment of Ariel Sharon as Foreign Minister by Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu in 1998 was a significant setback for the Middle East peace process, and its impact would be closely watched by the international community.   (Note: The year 1998 is incorrect, as the passage cites the appointment of Sharon in 1998, but the contexts suggest that the appointment occurred after 1998, possibly in 2001, when Sharon became Foreign Minister in Netanyahu's government.)  The year of Sharon's appointment as Foreign Minister is not specified in the provided contexts, but it is likely to be 2001.   The passage can be revised to reflect this correction.

In September the U.S. initiated legal action against a Sudanese arrested in Germany and in November charges were prepared against six men including bin Laden. The U.S. had, in support of its case, documentary evidence and a cooperative former senior aide of bin Laden. Meanwhile, authorities reported bin Laden agents active in Bangladesh and the Balkans and the Taliban government of Afghanistan proclaimed bin Laden \"a man without sin. Evidence shows Sudanese factory bombed by US is linked to bin Laden. US prosecutors ask for an extension to extradite a bin Laden lieutenant. FBI questions witnesses of Nairobi embassy blast, preparing for trial of 6 suspects. The Taliban says the US is using bin Laden as an excuse to attack Afghanistan. Goal of US August raid there was to kill bin Laden and his aides. The Taliban declares bin Laden a free man, with no proof of anti-US terror. 2 arrested for articles inciting Taliban-style revolt in Bangladesh. Bin Laden cell is in Albania and elsewhere in Europe. Bin Laden aide informs for the US. East African bin Laden cell has security woes in '97. In the aftermath of the almost simultaneous bombings of U.S. embassies in East Africa, much has been learned of the terrorist network put together and financed by Saudi billionaire Osama bin Laden. Osama bin Laden, the mastermind of the bombings and U.S. cruise missile attack against a supposed terrorist camp in Afghanistan shortly after the bombings was an attempt not only to disrupt the terrorist network but to get bin Laden himself. As the investigation into the bombings continues, more is being learned from seized computers and top aides turned informants. Bin Laden remains in Afghanistan by permission of the Taliban. Following the bombings of the embassies in Africa, the US began a full-scale assault on Osama bin Laden. Attacked were a chemical plant in the Sudan and a camp in Afghanistan where he was believed to be, creating an assassination opportunity. Evidence was gathered from a captured computer and an in-law who defected. Suspects were identified and the FBI began to build a case in New York. Extradition of a suspect from Germany was sought. Reactions from Islamic nations varied: Afghanistan promised him safe haven; more liberal Bandladesh arrested pro-Taliban reporters; Albania feared it was an infiltration center for the rest of Europe, including Kosovo.", "response": "The US government's actions following the August 1998 bombings of the US embassies in East Africa were swift and decisive. President Bill Clinton authorized cruise missile strikes against Osama bin Laden's compound in Afghanistan, which bin Laden survived. In response to the bombings, a federal grand jury in Manhattan indicted bin Laden on 238 counts of conspiring to bomb the embassies and committing acts of terrorism against Americans abroad, with rewards of $5 million each for information leading to his arrest or conviction. The Clinton administration had been concerned about bin Laden's organization even before the bombing and had considered a daring raid into Afghanistan to capture him, with a legal justification for military attacks against a terrorist leadership being drafted. The administration took action after the bombing, firing cruise missiles at a pharmaceutical factory in Sudan that may have been producing chemical weapons for al-Qaida. The government's knowledge of bin Laden's activities stems in part from the cooperation of an informant who worked for bin Laden, transporting weapons and explosives and assisting in running his finances. The investigation of bin Laden is ongoing, with the FBI fanning out around the world to look into the embassy attacks. \n\nThe US government's actions against Osama bin Laden were met with skepticism by the Taliban, with the Taliban's chief justice accusing the US of seeking an excuse to launch another missile attack on Afghanistan. The US had retaliated on August 20 by firing Tomahawk missiles at suspected terrorist camps in eastern Afghanistan, resulting in the deaths of 26 people. Administration officials acknowledged that one of the objectives of the August raid on Afghanistan was to kill Osama bin Laden and his lieutenants, with a secret review concluding that such operations are legal under U.S. and international law. The 1976 executive order prohibiting U.S. government employees from plotting or carrying out assassinations was seen as a precedent for future operations in similar circumstances, sparking intense debate over the years about its interpretation. The US government's actions against Osama bin Laden were a significant step in the global war on terror, with bin Laden's al-Qaida organization being blamed for numerous terror attacks, including the 1998 bombings of two US embassies in Africa that killed 231 people and the 2000 attack on the USS Cole that killed 17 American sailors in Yemen. Bin Laden's actions sparked a chain of events that led to wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, as well as a clandestine war against extreme Islamic adherents that touched scores of countries worldwide. \n\nNote: The passage is written within 500 words.
