{"id": "duc04-testb-0:1#3", "contents": "Rosina Lotempio has been standing outside abortion clinics for years, long before the rowdy protests of Operation Rescue and Lambs of Christ. She was there the morning before Dr. Barnett Slepian was fatally shot in his home, and she was there again, praying for abortions to stop. Mrs. Lotempio, 58, is a quiet presence on the sidewalk, with brown rosary beads in her hands and a small gold cross around her neck. Despite the difficulty of being there, she says she depends on God to guide her. The bombings, fiery rhetoric, and graphic posters may grab the headlines, but people like Mrs. Lotempio are the foot soldiers in the abortion battle. They call themselves street counselors, coming to the clinic to pray and talk to women, hoping to change their minds."}
