Members of the Lambs of Christ have been persistent figures in protests at the Buffalo women's clinic where Dr. Barnett Slepian worked before he was shot to death last month. Although no suspect has been identified in the shooting, officials are looking to question a Vermont man whose car was seen near Dr. Slepian's home, and who has participated in abortion protests for over a decade and has often been a house guest of other members of the Lambs of Christ."}
