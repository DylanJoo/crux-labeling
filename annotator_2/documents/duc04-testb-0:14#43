She was further moved to action after watching the anti-abortion film \"Silent Scream,\" which purported to show footage of an abortion. She began volunteering at a Catholic pregnancy center, encouraging women not to have abortions, and also started housing unwed mothers. She would often stand vigil outside local clinics where abortions were performed, protesting the procedure. Mrs. Hayes pointed to a prenatal image of her 3-month-old daughter, Bernadette, and noted that had she been someone else's child, she could have been a victim of a partial-birth abortion."}
