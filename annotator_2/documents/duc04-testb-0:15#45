The package, received by the Hamilton (Ontario) Spectator, contained a picture of an aborted fetus, sparking concerns about a potential connection to the fatal shooting of Dr. Barnett Slepian, a Buffalo, N.Y. doctor who provided abortions. The newspaper had received five similar packages in the past year, some with veiled threats, and employees reported that the individual delivering the packages resembled James Charles Kopp, a man wanted for questioning in the Slepian case."}
