{"id": "duc04-testb-0:16#49", "contents": "Kopp's involvement in the anti-abortion movement dates back to the late 1980s, when he was arrested in Atlanta during Operation Rescue's huge anti-abortion protests. He was also arrested in Levittown, Long Island, in 1991, and was involved in protests in Burlington, Vermont, in 1990. Kopp's actions have been described as part of a highly organized blockade, with links to the Army of God, a shadowy group that has claimed responsibility for some of the violence against abortion providers. An underground manual issued by the Army of God includes a tribute to Kopp, listing him as \"Atomic Dog\" in the \"Special Thanks\" section."}
