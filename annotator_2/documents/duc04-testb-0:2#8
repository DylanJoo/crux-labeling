Federal law prohibits protesters from coming within 15 feet of the clinic entrances and from leaning signs against the walls, but some protesters push these limits, leading to frustration and stress for clinic workers and guards. The protests can be particularly intense when patients arrive at the clinic, with some protesters resorting to screaming, yelling, and name-calling."}
