{"id": "duc04-testb-0:9#28", "contents": "The number of abortions in the United States has been declining steadily since the Roe vs. Wade decision in 1973, with approximately 1.5 million abortions performed annually. The number of providers identifying themselves as abortion performers has also decreased, from 2,908 in 1982 to 2,380 in 1992. Moreover, only 12% of residency programs offer routine training in abortions during the first trimester, contributing to a shortage of fully trained doctors. In contrast, cosmopolitan cities like New York maintain a steady level of abortion availability, albeit with concerns about the decreasing number of young doctors trained in performing abortions."}
