The fire, which was the deadliest in modern Swedish history, occurred at a facility rented by the Macedonian Association, a local immigrant group. The dance hall was packed with approximately 400 teenagers, mostly aged 13 to 18, despite having a maximum capacity of 150. The fast-spreading fire completely gutted the building, leaving rescuers to face a horrific scene that was likened to a \"gas chamber\" by local rescue service leader Lennart Olin."}
