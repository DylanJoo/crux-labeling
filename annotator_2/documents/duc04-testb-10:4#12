The fire was the deadliest in modern Swedish history since 1978, when 20 people died in the town of Boraas. Local rescue service leader Lennart Olin described the scene as reminiscent of the gas chambers at Auschwitz. Rescuers were met with a horrific sight when they first entered the building, with many victims choking to death on smoke and poisonous gases."}
