The hall was severely overcrowded, with estimates suggesting between 250 to 400 people were present, despite a maximum capacity of 150. The explosive fire quickly raised temperatures to 600 degrees, leaving many injured with severe burns. Authorities have identified 18 of the dead, but the process has been slow due to the lack of identification documents among the young victims. The disaster has left a community in shock, with many wondering if a quicker response could have saved lives."}
