The building had just two exits, one of which was blocked by fire, and youths trampled each other to get out, with other youths scuffling with police to get in and attempt to help friends. Prime Minister Goeran Persson visited the fire site at midday, and King Carl XVI Gustav made a statement of condolence, as the city of Goteborg struggled to come to terms with the tragedy."}
