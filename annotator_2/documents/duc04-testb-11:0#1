He claims to have been beaten by security guards. President Estrada, who considers Anwar a personal friend, has expressed support for him and suggested that he should be held under house arrest during his upcoming trial on corruption and sexual misconduct charges. Anwar has denied the charges, calling them politically motivated. Estrada has also indicated that he may not attend the Asia Pacific Rim nations summit in Malaysia next month. Despite this, Estrada emphasized that his support for Anwar is personal and moral, and not intended to interfere in Malaysia's internal affairs."}
