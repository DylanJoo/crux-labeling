The popular former deputy prime minister was fired on September 2, and after two weeks of nationwide rallies, he was arrested under a law that allows police to hold him indefinitely. Mahathir has denounced the demonstrators, calling them part of a plot to topple the government. Anwar's case has drawn international attention, with the presidents of the Philippines and Indonesia raising concerns and the United States considering downgrading President Bill Clinton's visit to Kuala Lumpur next month."}
