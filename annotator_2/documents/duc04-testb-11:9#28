Habibie's decision would be influenced by his difficulties in leaving the country while dealing with internal problems, including the absence of a vice president. This would not be the first time Habibie has canceled a trip to Malaysia, as he previously postponed a state visit due to domestic issues. The private meeting between Estrada and Habibie was delayed due to a mechanical fault in one of the Indonesian helicopters, which was meant to transport Estrada's entourage."}
