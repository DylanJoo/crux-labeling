According to Israeli official Nir Yarkoni, Palestinian airport workers refused to allow Israeli security officials to check the identity of passengers who arrived on an Egyptian plane on Sunday afternoon. Most of the passengers worked for the Palestinian Authority. As a result, the Transportation Minister has asked Yarkoni to inform the Palestinians that the airport will not be allowed to operate if this continues."}
