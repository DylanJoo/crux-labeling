The event was marked by cheers, tears, and an outpouring of patriotism as an Egypt Air plane landed on the desert tarmac in the southern Gaza Strip at 8:30 a.m. (0630 gmt). The emotional highlight was the touchdown of the first Palestinian Airlines plane, a Fokker 50, with the pilot and co-pilot raising Palestinian flags high above their heads as they descended the stairway. The crowd of thousands of Palestinians who had gathered on the airfield to join the celebrations chanted \"Allahu Akbar,\" or God is Great."}
