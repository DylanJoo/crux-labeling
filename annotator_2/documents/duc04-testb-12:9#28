{"id": "duc04-testb-12:9#28", "contents": "The airport's opening was a result of negotiations during last month's U.S.-sponsored Mideast summit near Washington. As part of the accord, Israel withdrew troops in the northern West Bank last week and released 250 Palestinian prisoners. The airport is expected to provide a boost to the troubled Palestinian economy, permitting the export of Palestinian flowers and farm produce that until now were shipped out via Israel, often with difficulties and delays. The airfield will also make it easier for Palestinians to travel abroad, although a majority of Gazans are probably too poor to be able to afford an air ticket."}
