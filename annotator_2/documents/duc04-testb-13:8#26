The Pakistanis have opted for trust and nationalism. \"Oh, Viagra,\" exclaimed Pakistani medical officer Yousef Baig. \"They know all about it and they know all about Bangkok. We have told them, don't break our trust and keep the good name of Pakistan flying high,\" Dr. Baig said. China has taken a similar approach. \"We don't treat them as kids, telling them don't do this, don't do that. We just told them to leave a good impression of Chinese athletes,\" said Li Furong, deputy head of the Chinese delegation."}
