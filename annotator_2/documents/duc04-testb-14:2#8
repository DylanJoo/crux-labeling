Police checkpoints have become more relaxed, and areas previously sealed off by the Yugoslav army are now open to diplomatic monitors. However, a NATO military officer noted that this superficial calm is not enough, as the Serb military has the capacity to resume fighting quickly. The officer also stated that a cease-fire in Kosovo is \"pretty much enacted,\" but that the interior ministry police must reduce their presence around villages to allow refugees to return. Holbrooke is scheduled to meet with ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova in Pristina on Tuesday to present a political proposal for the future status of Kosovo."}
