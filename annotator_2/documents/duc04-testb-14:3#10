To avoid such an attack, Yugoslavia must end hostilities, withdraw its forces, address the humanitarian crisis, allow refugees to return, and engage in peace talks. NATO's decision may depend on a report by UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan on whether Yugoslavia is meeting UN demands. Serb authorities have installed an interim government in Kosovo, but ethnic Albanian rebels have rejected this move, and the conflict continues to claim lives and displace hundreds of thousands."}
