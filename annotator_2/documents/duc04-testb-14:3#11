The Yugoslav government claims that the fighting has ended, but blames continuing violence on ethnic Albanian rebels. The US and Europeans want an end to the fighting, but also oppose independence for Kosovo, fearing it could destabilize other Balkan countries. The Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) has offered to assist NATO forces if asked, and has accused ethnic Albanian politicians of abandoning the cause of independence. Reports of massacres of ethnic Albanian civilians have increased momentum for outside involvement, with Britain reportedly preparing troops and armored units for a post-airstrike peacekeeping role."}
