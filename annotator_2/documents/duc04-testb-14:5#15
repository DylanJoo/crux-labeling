However, Milosevic showed no signs of backing down, and his office issued a statement denouncing NATO threats as a ``criminal act'' that favored separatist ethnic Albanian guerrillas. The statement claimed there had been no fighting in the Serbian province for the past seven days and that the crisis represented no threat to other countries in the southern Balkans."}
