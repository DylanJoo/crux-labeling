Although Russia opposes the use of NATO force in Kosovo, Ivanov and Sergeyev warned that airstrikes could occur if decisive measures are not taken to improve the situation. To avoid an attack, Yugoslavia must end hostilities, withdraw its forces, address the humanitarian crisis, allow refugees to return home, and participate in peace talks."}
