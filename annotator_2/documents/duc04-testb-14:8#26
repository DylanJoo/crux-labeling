{"id": "duc04-testb-14:8#26", "contents": "The heart of the disagreement in Kosovo is between Serbia, Yugoslavia's principal republic, which insists on keeping Kosovo as a province, and the ethnic Albanians there who have chafed under Milosevic's repression since he stripped the province of virtual autonomy in 1989, and who now seek independence. U.S. officials said they expected Richard Holbrooke, the U.S. envoy who dealt with Milosevic in negotiating an end to the war in Bosnia, to meet with him on Monday to discuss a political plan for Kosovo. The plan is believed to call for a three-year interim period leading to a status fairly close to the pre-1989 autonomy arrangement, in an effort to mediate a middle course between the two sides."}
