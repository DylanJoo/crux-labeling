The governor, a Republican, added, ``What we don't need is a bunch of wingnuts coming in.'' Shepard was born in Casper and attended elementary school, junior high and several years of high school and college there. With flags at Casper's public schools flying at half-staff, many mourners were his old classmates. Others traveled from as far away as New Jersey, out of a sense of solidarity, to pay their respects to Shepard and his family."}
