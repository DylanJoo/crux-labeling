{"id": "duc04-testb-15:13#39", "contents": "As a gay college student, Matthew Shepard, lay hospitalized in critical condition after a severe beating in Laramie, Wyoming, the small city, which bills itself as \"Wyoming's hometown,\" wrestled with its attitudes towards gay men. On Saturday, at the University of Wyoming's annual homecoming parade, a larger group of marchers, approximately 450 people, many wearing yellow armbands and carrying signs in support of Shepard, overshadowed \"Pistol Pete\" and his uniformed brass band. The signs read, \"Hate is not a Small Town Value _ No to Violence and Evil\" and \"No Hate Crimes in Wyoming.\" Two candlelight vigils were held Sunday night at churches near the campus. At the Poudre Valley Hospital in Fort Collins, Colo., where Shepard's health continued to deteriorate, the hospital received so many flowers that nurses started distributing bouquets to other patients."}
