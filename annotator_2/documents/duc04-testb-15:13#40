{"id": "duc04-testb-15:13#40", "contents": "The brutal assault on Shepard bubbled out of an ongoing climate of hostility toward gay men and lesbians, leaders of the local Unitarian church said in a letter published Sunday in the city's newspaper, The Laramie Daily Boomerang. Gay people in Laramie, they wrote, \"are frequently assaulted with derision, intolerance, insult and hostility _ if not guns and ropes.\" Ric Turley, who dropped out of college in Laramie after one year in the 1970s, recalled driving to see his family for Christmas in 1993 and seeing a vandalized billboard on the main highway with a message changed from \"Shoot a Day or Two\" to \"Shoot a Gay or Two.\" Turley, who is gay, said that he immediately complained to the museum, but the message was not erased until he took a can of black spray paint and blotted out the word \"gay.\" \"It was this kind of complacency and apathy that allowed this to happen,\" he said of the beating."}
