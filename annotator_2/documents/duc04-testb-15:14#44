The family has been touched by the kindness and love shown by strangers and friends alike. Despite the presence of a small group of protesters outside the funeral, the mourners stood strong, singing \"Amazing Grace\" and holding umbrellas to block the sight of the protesters. The city of Laramie has also taken action, passing an emergency ordinance banning protests near the funeral. Shepard's death has become a catalyst for a new drive to guarantee physical safety for the LGBTQ+ community, with a federal bill pending to add extra penalties for crimes motivated by a victim's sexual orientation, gender, or disability."}
