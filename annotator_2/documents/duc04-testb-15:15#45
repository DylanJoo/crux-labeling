Jim Geringer of Wyoming had warned anti-gay protesters to stay away from the funeral of Matthew Shepard, stating they were \"just flat not welcome.\" Many mourners, including Shepard's old classmates, attended the funeral, with flags at Casper's public schools flying at half-staff. Some people traveled from as far away as New Jersey to pay their respects, driven by a sense of solidarity. One mourner, Steve Pietrangelo, drove 300 miles to attend the funeral, saying he had a \"pit in his heart and stomach\" since hearing about Shepard's murder."}
