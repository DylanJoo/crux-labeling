He suffered severe injuries to his face and neck, as well as a massive blow to the back of his skull. The attack was seen as a hate crime, with many believing that Shepard was targeted because of his sexual orientation. According to Brian Levin, director of the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism, \"Because of their social stature in society, gays are often viewed as appropriate targets.\" Levin emphasized the need for hate crime laws to send a clear message to gay bashers that such behavior is not socially acceptable."}
