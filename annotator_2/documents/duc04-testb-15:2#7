While some gay leaders saw crucifixion imagery in Shepard's death, others saw a different symbolism: the Old West practice of nailing a dead coyote to a ranch fence as a warning to future intruders. This imagery highlights the dehumanizing and violent treatment of Shepard, who was left to die like an animal. Beatrice Dorhn, legal director of the Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund, emphasized that Shepard's death was not just the fault of his attackers, but also the result of a broader societal problem."}
