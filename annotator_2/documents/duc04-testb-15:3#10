They also imply that homosexuality is a disease in need of a cure. The Family Research Council's Web site proudly describes its readiness to \"wage the war against the homosexual agenda and fight to maintain the traditional meaning of 'family.'\" The head of the Family Research Council, Gary Bauer, disingenuously claims that his organization hates no one and deplores violence, but the reality is that the organization's rhetoric emboldens thugs to commit violent acts against gay people."}
