{"id": "duc04-testb-15:3#11", "contents": "The recent murder of Matthew Shepard is just the latest example of the violence that can result from the kind of hate-filled rhetoric promoted by the Family Research Council and other religious right groups. Despite the brutal nature of Shepard's murder, no major GOP leader has dared to take on the \"religious\" wing of the party and its crusade against gay people. Instead, they continue to promote a message of hate and intolerance, as seen in the recent ads and in the words of politicians like Trent Lott, who has condemned gay people as sinful and sick. The contrast between this message and the loving words of Matthew's mother, Judy Shepard, could not be more stark."}
