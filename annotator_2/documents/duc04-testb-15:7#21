The 22-year-old University of Wyoming student was in a coma in critical condition. Russell Henderson and Aaron McKinney were arraigned on charges of kidnapping, aggravated robbery, and attempted first-degree murder. Two women, Kristen Leann Price and Chastity Vera Pasley, were charged as accessories after the fact to attempted first-degree murder. Shepard's friends said he did not know his alleged tormentors, and police believe the primary motive was robbery, although Shepard's homosexuality may have also been a factor."}
