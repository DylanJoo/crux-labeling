Democrats might try to turn the image of Clinton in the dock to their advantage in states with a Democratic edge or with sizable numbers of black voters, who overwhelmingly support the president. In these contests, a Democratic candidate might denounce the president's behavior but pledge to vote against impeachment, potentially proving effective. This approach could emerge in states like California, New York, Illinois, Wisconsin, Washington, and Arkansas."}
