It would also be a symbolic victory for the senator, who has sought to rebrand himself as a centrist. A D'Amato endorsement would weaken Schumer's efforts to portray him as a right-wing extremist and signify a fraying of the traditional Democratic coalition. The debate surrounding the endorsement highlights the importance of the New York Senate race to Democrats, who see defeating D'Amato as a key opportunity to prevent Republicans from gaining 60 seats in the Senate."}
