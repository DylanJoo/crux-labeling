Since 1993, D'Amato has backed the right of gay citizens to serve in the military, sponsored legislation to prevent job discrimination against gay workers, and opposed his own leadership's attempts to block the nominations of two openly gay men to positions in the Clinton administration. To gay supporters of D'Amato, an endorsement by the Human Rights Campaign would signify the political maturation of the gay electorate and help the organization insulate itself from accusations that it is too close to the Democratic Party."}
