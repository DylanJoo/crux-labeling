{"id": "duc04-testb-16:19#58", "contents": "Despite some narrowing in the opinion polls, Boyle still trails Voinovich by 10-18 percentage points. The electoral dynamics of Ohio also favor Voinovich, with the northern half of the state traditionally voting Democratic and the southern tier leaning Republican. Additionally, Voinovich's reputation as a moderate Republican who works well with Democrats has earned him a strong reputation in the state. Boyle, on the other hand, is trying to capitalize on her underdog status, saying it has allowed her to be more focused and intense in her campaign."}
