He also points out that Boyle was a member of the state Legislature during the period cited in the Supreme Court ruling that found the state's school funding formula to be unconstitutional. Boyle, however, remains committed to her campaign, saying that despite the challenges, she is focused on reminding the people of Ohio that Voinovich failed to deliver on his promise to be the \"education governor.\" With the election nearing, both candidates are continuing to campaign vigorously, with Voinovich balancing his campaign with his official duties as governor."}
