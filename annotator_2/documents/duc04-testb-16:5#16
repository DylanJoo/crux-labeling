{"id": "duc04-testb-16:5#16", "contents": "The Human Rights Campaign is considered the most influential gay and lesbian organization in Washington, with a national membership of 250,000 and an annual budget of more than $13 million. The group was created in the early 1980s in large part to counter the rise of the Christian right and Ronald Reagan. D'Amato, who has aggressively courted gay voters, has backed the right of gay citizens to serve in the military, sponsored legislation to prevent job discrimination against gay workers, and opposed his own leadership's attempts to block the nominations of two openly gay men to positions in the Clinton administration. An endorsement by the Human Rights Campaign would represent a crowning achievement in his efforts to reposition himself as a moderate."}
