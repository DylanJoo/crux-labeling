{"id": "duc04-testb-16:7#21", "contents": "Reps. David Price and Julia Carson are two Democratic incumbents who, in other election years, would have had little in common other than their party affiliation and relatively safe seats. Price is a centrist who has represented his high-tech district in North Carolina for all but 2 of the last 12 years, with a background as a political scientist who has taught at Duke and Yale. Mrs. Carson, on the other hand, is a fairly liberal House freshman who worked her way up in politics from the grass roots, having been reared in poverty. However, party officials are beginning to worry that Democratic incumbents like Price and Mrs. Carson share something else: greater-than-expected peril on Election Day."}
