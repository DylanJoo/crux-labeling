Witnesses reported hearing a series of small explosions before the car, a red Fiat, blew up. Yair Cohen, a 43-year-old shopper, described the scene: \"People started to shout 'car on fire.' After a while, we heard a blast, and something hit me in the stomach.\" Cohen was treated for minor injuries at Hadassah Hospital. The blast left a trail of destruction, with flames shooting 100 feet in the air and streams of soot-black water running in the street."}
