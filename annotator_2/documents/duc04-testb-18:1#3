{"id": "duc04-testb-18:1#3", "contents": "House Speaker-designate Bob Livingston's decision to resign his post was reportedly driven in part by the anger of a group of about a dozen conservatives in his party. These conservatives were disillusioned that Livingston had withheld news of his affairs from them, and they had threatened to withhold their votes for him in the January election that would formally make him speaker. Livingston was also concerned about the pain caused to his family by further disclosures. Additionally, many in his party noted that his resignation would set an example for the president, who was also facing impeachment proceedings."}
