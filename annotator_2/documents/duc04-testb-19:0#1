It will fly alone for two weeks before rendezvousing with the American space shuttle Endeavour, which is scheduled to be launched on December 3 carrying the Unity connecting module. The international space station is a U.S.-led successor to Russia's Mir space station and is expected to facilitate unprecedented international cooperation in space in the 21st century."}
