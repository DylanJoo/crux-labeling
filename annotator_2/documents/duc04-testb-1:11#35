This would allow teams above the salary cap to sign one free agent per year for the average salary. The union's executive director, Billy Hunter, expressed optimism about the proposal, saying that the players have made a \"valiant effort\" to reach an agreement. However, he also emphasized that the players are not willing to accept a \"bad deal\" and are prepared to hold out if necessary. The proposal marks a significant development in the labor negotiations, which have been ongoing for several months."}
