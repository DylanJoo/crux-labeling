{"id": "duc04-testb-1:13#40", "contents": "Larry Bird's name has become synonymous with a rule that allows teams to exceed the salary cap to re-sign their own players. This \"Larry Bird exception\" was originally used in 1988 when the Celtics gave Bird a $4.9 million bonus to push through his back pain and continue playing. The rule has since become a contentious issue in the NBA, with owners arguing that it creates an unfair advantage and allows for excessive spending. Bird himself has said that he understands both sides of the argument, but believes that it is important for players to stay with the same team for franchise stability and fan identification."}
