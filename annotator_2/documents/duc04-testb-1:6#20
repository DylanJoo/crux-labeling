{"id": "duc04-testb-1:6#20", "contents": "The union filed a grievance with Feerick prior to the lockout, arguing that the owners should have included lockout language in the standard player contract to protect themselves from liability. The Sacramento Kings' contract with Olden Polynice, which included a lockout clause, was cited as an example. The NBA, on the other hand, contends that labor law allows employers to withhold pay during a lockout. The league also presented testimony from former union director Simon Gourdine, who claimed that it was understood that players would not be paid during a lockout when the previous labor agreement was negotiated in 1995."}
