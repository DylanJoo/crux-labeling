The main sticking point is the owners' insistence on a salary cap without exceptions, which they believe would bring player salaries in line with revenue growth. The players association proposed a taxation system, which includes a 50% tax on salary earned above $18 million, affecting only a few players who exercised their Bird rights. The owners are expected to respond to the proposal by Friday."}
