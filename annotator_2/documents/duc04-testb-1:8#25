If the 63% threshold is met, a reduction in annual 20% raises would take effect for multi-year contracts. Players would receive either 10% raises or the rate of growth in league revenues. The union believes this provision addresses the owners' concerns. Additionally, teams would gain a right of first refusal on free agents after the fourth year for incoming rookies, allowing them to retain players for a longer period."}
