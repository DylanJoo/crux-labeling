{"id": "duc04-testb-20:0#1", "contents": "The China Democracy Party has been the target of a concerted crackdown by security forces, who have trampled on China's limited legal safeguards to crush the opposition group. At least 32 people have been detained or questioned in the past three weeks, and Xu, Wang, and another leading member, Qin Yongmin, have been put on trial on subversion charges. Xu and Qin were given less than four days to prepare their defenses, and Wang and Qin faced trials without legal counsel after police detained or intimidated potential lawyers. The courts found Xu and Wang guilty of plotting subversion by founding branches of the China Democracy Party and accepting money from abroad."}
