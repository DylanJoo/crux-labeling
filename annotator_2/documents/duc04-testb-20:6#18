In a speech to senior law enforcement officials, Jiang used uncompromising language, demanding that officials \"talk politics\" and follow party orders. This harsh tone was punctuated by the summary trials and convictions of three political critics, Xu Wenli, Qin Yongmin, and Wang Youcai, who were given 13-, 12-, and 11-year prison terms for subversion. National newspapers ran brief accounts of the trials, serving as a warning to China's 1.2 billion people."}
