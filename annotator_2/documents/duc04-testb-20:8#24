Xu Wenli, a 55-year-old dissident leader who has already spent 12 years in prison, was sentenced to 13 years for \"subversion of state power.\" His alleged crimes included helping to organize a new political party, calling for an end to Communist rule, and accepting $500 from a dissident abroad. Xu was defended by a court-appointed lawyer who met him only once before the trial."}
