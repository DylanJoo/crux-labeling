His trial was brief, with no defense lawyer present. The punishment of Qin Yongmin, a 44-year-old veteran democracy campaigner, has not been announced, but a similarly long sentence is expected. The harsh sentences have been criticized by the State Department and have crushed the hopes of many liberal intellectuals in China who had expected a easing of political controls."}
