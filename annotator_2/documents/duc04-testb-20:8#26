Xu has given his adult life to the cause of democracy and has been a persistent critic of the Communist government. He first came to prominence during the Democracy Wall movement of the late 1970s and has since served 12 years in prison. Xu and Qin had been using fax machines and e-mail to draw attention to China's obligations under two international covenants it has signed, but their activities were met with temporary detentions and warnings."}
