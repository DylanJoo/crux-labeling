The trials, which proceeded with no defense attorneys, showed that in cases involving security issues, police and courts could write their own rules. Xu was not notified of his trial until four days in advance, and his wife was not allowed to contact him until three days before the trial. Xu's lawyer, Mo Shaoping, was assigned by the court and only met with Xu briefly before the trial."}
