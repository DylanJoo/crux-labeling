{"id": "duc04-testb-21:1#3", "contents": "Gale-force winds and high seas battered yachts in the Sydney-to-Hobart race Monday, killing at least two crew members and leaving two yachts missing. The two dead were found on the 40-foot vessel Business Post Naiad, about 100 kilometers (60 miles) off the New South Wales state town of Merimbula. One of the missing yachts, B-52, was found mid-morning Monday and was making its way towards Eden on the New South Wales coast, with all nine crew members thought to be safe. The Australian Search and Rescue Coordination Center (AusSAR) in Canberra reported that no word had been received on the fate of the Winston Churchill or the sailor swept from the deck of Sword of Orion on Sunday night."}
