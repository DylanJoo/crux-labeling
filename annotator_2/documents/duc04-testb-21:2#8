{"id": "duc04-testb-21:2#8", "contents": "Winston Churchill skipper Richard Winning was one of the four rescued. The first recorded death in the race, which started in 1945, was in 1984 when a 72-year-old yachtsman was washed overboard from Yahoo 2 and presumed drowned. In 1989, a 58-year-old man died from head injuries on the yacht Flying Colours after a 45-knot gale off the southern NSW coast snapped the boat's mast. About half of the 115-yacht fleet have been forced out of the 1,160-kilometer (725-mile) race. The American maxi Sayonara was narrowly ahead of last year's winner, Brindabella, and expected to cross the line Tuesday."}
