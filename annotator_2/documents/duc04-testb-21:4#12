Sayonara, raced by American computer billionaire Larry Ellison, has only been beaten once since it was launched in 1995 and is aiming for its second win in the 630 nautical mile bluewater classic. If the 80-footer beats the local boats home into Hobart, it will be third time in four years a foreign yacht has finished first."}
