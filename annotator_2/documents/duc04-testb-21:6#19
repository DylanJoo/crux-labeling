{"id": "duc04-testb-21:6#19", "contents": "The severe weather conditions, with winds gusting up to 90 mph and seas reaching 35 feet, made the search and rescue efforts challenging. A sailor was swept off the Sword of Orion when the 30-foot boat rolled in wild seas near Gabo Island on Sunday night. The yacht, which had a crew of 11, was halfway across Bass Strait when it overturned. There was no sign of the missing sailor, and it was unclear how long they could survive in the water. The missing yachts included the veteran cutter Winston Churchill, B-52, and Solo Globe Challenger."}
