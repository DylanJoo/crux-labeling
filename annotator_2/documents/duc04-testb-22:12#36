Bashkim Delijaj said he had stayed behind to look after his bedridden father. He recalled seeing a tank convoy approaching, with infantry behind the tanks, and soldiers in brown army uniforms with huge knives or small axes, many with beards. Bashkim Delijaj was unable to carry his father to safety and did not have the courage to tell him what was happening, instead telling him he was getting the animals out of the barn."}
