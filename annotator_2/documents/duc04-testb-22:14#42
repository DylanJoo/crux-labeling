{"id": "duc04-testb-22:14#42", "contents": "The investigation into the Ra\u010dak massacre was hindered by the Yugoslav government's reluctance to issue visas to investigators from the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia. The tribunal was only granted a handful of visas, which limited their ability to conduct a thorough investigation. Two investigators who were present in Kosovo at the time of the massacre departed six days later without visiting the site or contacting key witnesses, such as Krasniqi, to gather information about the killings."}
