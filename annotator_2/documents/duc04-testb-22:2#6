Radislav Krstic, a Bosnian Serb general who was secretly indicted for genocide by the international war crimes tribunal. Krstic, who was taken into custody without incident in the American sector in northeast Bosnia, is the highest-ranking official to be seized so far and the first serving military officer. He is accused of directing the attack on Srebrenica in 1995, which resulted in the deaths of approximately 7,000 Bosnian Muslim men. The indictment accuses Krstic of committing genocide during and after the fall of Srebrenica between July 11 and November 1, 1995."}
