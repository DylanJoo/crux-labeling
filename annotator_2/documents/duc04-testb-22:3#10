He lost a leg in a mine explosion in 1994 and had previously served as an officer in the Yugoslav Army. At the time of the Srebrenica massacre, Krstic had responsibility for \"anti-terrorist units\" that were given some of the most difficult tasks. Many believe that these units were involved in the killings. In Banja Luka, some members of the Bosnian Serb parliament protested Krstic's arrest, arguing that he was simply doing his job as a soldier."}
