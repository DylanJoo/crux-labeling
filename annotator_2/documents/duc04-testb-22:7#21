{"id": "duc04-testb-22:7#21", "contents": "Opening a genocide trial Monday at the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal, U.N. prosecutor Terree Bowers described Bosnian Serb Goran Jelisic as \"the face of genocide\" who bragged about killing 20 or 30 Muslims before his morning coffee. Jelisic, a 30-year-old mechanic, used the nickname Adolf \"with a perverse pride in the genocidal symbolism it represented.\" He pleaded guilty in October to murdering 12 Muslims and Croats in and around the Serb-run Luka camp in Brcko, northern Bosnia, in May 1992. The trial will allow prosecutors to present evidence about the background of Jelisic's murders, including the involvement of more senior Serbs, and give survivors a chance to tell their story in court."}
