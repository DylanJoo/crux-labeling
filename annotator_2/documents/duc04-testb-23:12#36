The goal is to slash $19 billion from the budget deficit, and Cardoso is leading by example. The palace's 2,000 workers will no longer enjoy free haircuts, phone calls, or afternoon snacks. The three barber shops in the palace have been closed, and the use of cellular phones and copiers has been restricted. The price of the employee lunch buffet has also been increased from $6 to $8.50. These measures are expected to save nearly $145,000 per month."}
