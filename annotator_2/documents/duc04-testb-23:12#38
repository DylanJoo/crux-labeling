However, some governors are promising pay raises and public works projects that could undermine the austerity plan. In Brasilia, Joaquim Roriz has promised civil service raises, bonuses, and new jobs, which his opponent estimates would cost around $1 billion. Cardoso is reportedly planning to introduce measures to rein in the free-spending habits of provincial politicians, including holding local governments to bimonthly limits on spending. Federal funding would be cut off if spending exceeds these limits."}
