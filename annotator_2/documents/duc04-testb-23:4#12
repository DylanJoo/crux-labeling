{"id": "duc04-testb-23:4#12", "contents": "Robert Rubin, former undersecretary of commerce for international affairs, has expressed concerns about the effectiveness of the economic aid packages being proposed for Brazil and Japan. In Brazil, the issue is whether the package will be sufficient to address the country's exploding debt problem, while in Japan, the question is whether real reform will accompany the financial assistance. Rubin senses that the US has limited leverage in Tokyo, where political gridlock is the primary obstacle, but believes that the US can have a greater impact in Brazil by supporting an economic reform program without appearing to dictate terms."}
