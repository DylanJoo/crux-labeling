Born into a family of rural laborers, he was forced to leave school at a young age and learn the trade of car mechanic. However, he managed to publish a small novel at the age of 25. Later, he worked at a Lisbon publishing company, but the oppressive atmosphere of the Salazar dictatorship discouraged him from writing. It was only after Portugal's April 1974 revolution that Saramago felt free to find his voice. He served as editor of a Lisbon newspaper, Diario de Noticias, and later turned to novels, publishing three in succession in the late 1970s."}
