The book tells the story of a war veteran and a visionary who attempt to escape to the heavens aboard a flying machine. Set in 18th-century Portugal during the Inquisition, the novel explores themes of history, society, and individual perspective. The Swedish Academy praised the novel, noting its \"rich, multifaceted, and polysemous\" text. The novel's success was followed by other critically acclaimed works, including \"The Year of the Death of Ricardo Reis,\" which pays homage to the great Portuguese poet Fernando Pessoa."}
