{"id": "duc04-testb-24:2#8", "contents": "The discoveries honored on Monday were made largely during the 1980s at a time when scientists knew that bacteria produced nitric oxide but did not think it was important in animals and humans. The award committee said that ``this was the first discovery that a gas can act as a signal molecule in the organism.'' The discovery was startling because ``nitric oxide is totally different from any other known signal molecule and so unstable that it is converted to nitrate and nitrite within 10 seconds.'' The winners expressed surprise and gratitude upon receiving the award, with Furchgott saying he had planned to sleep late on Monday but was awakened at 5:30 to receive the news."}
