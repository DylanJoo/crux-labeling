{"id": "duc04-testb-24:3#10", "contents": "Inhalation of nitric oxide gas has saved the lives of some people with certain lung diseases, particularly infants who have developed dangerously high pulmonary blood pressure. But regulating the amount of nitric oxygen inhaled is critical because too much can be lethal. Nitric oxide plays a harmful role in the collapse of the circulatory system, or shock, resulting from overwhelming microbial infections. Bacteria can release products that cause white blood cells to release enormous amounts of nitric oxide. As a result, blood pressure drops. Scientists are trying to develop drugs that can block production of nitric oxide in such infections."}
