Nobel's will says the prize should recognize literature that works ``in an ideal direction.'' What, exactly, he meant by ``ideal'' is unclear, and the Academy's choices have reflected the confusion. Despite the inclarity around the edges, Allen said he is confident that the Academy's choices bolster Nobel's core idea that ``literature would be the basis for some kind of progress.'' About this year's choice, he won't say more than that: the Academy is bound to keep its deliberations secret."}
