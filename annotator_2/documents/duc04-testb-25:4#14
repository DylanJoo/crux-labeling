The LRA's leader, Joseph Kony, was reportedly badly wounded last week and is currently in a hospital in Juba, the largest town still under government control in southern Sudan. The Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) has been fighting government troops in the region and recently destroyed the LRA's largest camp at al-Gabelain. The LRA had allegedly been planning to bomb several sites in the Ugandan capital, including the Parliament building and state-run Radio Uganda."}
