{"id": "duc04-testb-25:5#17", "contents": "A column of rebel reinforcements, consisting of hundreds of rebel troops and Rwandan soldiers, marched through dense tropical forest to reinforce their comrades at Kindu. The soldiers, war-weary and physically exhausted, walked by abandoned roadside hamlets, resting in the shade of umbrella-shaped acacia trees. The silence of their march was interrupted only by the singing of crickets and the clanging of bullet belts hanging around their necks. The soldiers stopped for the night at the bridge over the chocolate-colored Elila River, which guards the path to Kindu. The government in Kinshasa has yet to comment on the latest developments, despite claiming earlier in the week that it was in control of the tarmac bridge."}
