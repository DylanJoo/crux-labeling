However, a Congo Airlines executive disputed this claim, stating that the victims were actually civilians being evacuated from Kindu, a town approximately 1,000 kilometers east of the capital, Kinshasa. Unfortunately, neither account could be confirmed independently. According to Stavros Papaioannou, the president of the airline's management committee, a missile hit the rear engine of the Boeing jet shortly after takeoff from Kindu airport."}
