He claimed that 3,500 rebel troops and their Rwandan allies had closed in on government forces from three directions after a week of fighting. The rebels now control one-third of Kindu, which the government has used as a staging area for a counteroffensive against rebel positions in the east. The rebels accuse President Laurent Kabila of corruption, failing to carry out promised democratic reforms, and stirring up hatred among Congo's 400 tribes."}
