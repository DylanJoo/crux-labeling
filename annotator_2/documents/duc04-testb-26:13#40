The report alleged that the ANC had tortured suspected spies and dissidents, killed innocent civilians with landmines and bombs, and executed suspected traitors in its camps abroad. Deputy President Mbeki, who is likely to succeed Mandela as president in 1999, has taken a hardline stance against the report, suggesting that all ANC members should do the same. This has created tension within the party, with Mandela's admission of wrongdoing at odds with Mbeki's denial."}
