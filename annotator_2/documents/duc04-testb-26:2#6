{"id": "duc04-testb-26:2#6", "contents": "South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) made a straightforward offer: confess your crimes, apply for amnesty, and you'll go free. If you don't come forward, you'll face prosecution. After more than two years of hearings into apartheid-era atrocities, the commission released a 3,500-page report naming dozens of individuals implicated in the violence but never applied for amnesty. However, instead of prosecutions, talk of new amnesty deals has begun. Many political parties, including the ruling African National Congress (ANC), have officials who could face prosecution due to the report. This has led to discussions about the potential for a new amnesty, with some parties calling for a general amnesty and the ANC leaving the door open for a tailored amnesty specific to violence between black South Africans."}
