Luxembourg, with its low unemployment and high standard of living, has the highest percentage of residents from other European countries, at nearly a third. Belgium, with the European Commission and NATO headquarters, is second, with 5.4 percent. Britain, despite not joining the euro, is seen as a hub for the New Europeans, attracting bankers and business executives with its financial district and flexible bureaucracy."}
