Now the European Union has a 12-year-old scholarship program, called Socrates-Erasmus, that this year allowed 200,000 European university students _ 5 percent of the EU's entire university population _ to study in other countries within the Union for up to a year, free. This program has enabled a measure of meritocracy to creep into European business, allowing individuals from diverse backgrounds to access opportunities that were previously inaccessible. Moreover, the proliferation of business schools in Europe, offering U.S.-style MBA programs, has taught an American approach to business, further breaking down social barriers."}
