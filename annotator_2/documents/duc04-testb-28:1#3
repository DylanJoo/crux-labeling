{"id": "duc04-testb-28:1#3", "contents": "U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan met with Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi in a desert tent, discussing the possibility of bringing two suspects to trial in the bombing of a Pan Am airliner. Annan expressed optimism that an arrangement could be secured in the \"not too distant future.\" However, no agreement was reached on handing over Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah, who are suspected in the 1988 bombing that killed 270 people. Annan's comments came after a meeting with Gadhafi, which followed talks with Libyan Foreign Minister Omar al-Muntasser in Sirte. State-run Libyan Radio quoted an unnamed official as saying that \"a solution to this crisis is within reach,\" crediting Annan's talks with al-Muntasser."}
