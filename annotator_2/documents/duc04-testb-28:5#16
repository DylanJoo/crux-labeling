However, the United States and Britain insist that the suspects should serve their sentence in Britain. The Libyan parliament meeting, which is expected to last five days, is being held in the northern coastal town of Sirte and is being broadcast live on national television. Libyan media have suggested that Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi does not have the authority to hand over the suspects, and any decision would need to be approved by the Congress."}
