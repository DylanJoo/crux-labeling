Secretary-General Kofi Annan arrived in Libya on Saturday for talks aimed at bringing to trial two Libyan suspects in the 1988 Pan Am bombing over Lockerbie, Scotland. Annan's one-day visit to meet with Libyan leader Col. Moammar Gadhafi followed reports in the Libyan media that Gadhafi had no authority to hand over the suspects. This position would indicate that Gadhafi is giving himself enough diplomatic room in the event he decides against giving up the suspects. Annan flew aboard a special plane from the Tunisian resort island of Jerba after receiving a clearance from the U.N. Sanctions Committee to make the flight."}
