They are accused by the United States and Britain of blowing up a Pan Am airliner over the Scottish village of Lockerbie on Dec. 21, 1988. All 259 people aboard the Boeing 747 and 11 people on ground were killed. A Libyan legal team has been meeting regularly with Annan's legal counsel to discuss a U.S.-British proposal to try the suspects in the Netherlands according to Scottish law and using Scottish judges."}
