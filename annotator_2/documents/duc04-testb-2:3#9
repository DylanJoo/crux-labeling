The investigation centers on the payment of nearly $400,000 in scholarships to relatives of IOC members by the Salt Lake bid committee, which won the right to stage the 2002 games. IOC vice president Dick Pound, heading the Salt Lake inquiry, stated that the executive board takes this matter very seriously and has never had anything come forward despite previous rumors and allegations of corruption in other Olympic votes."}
