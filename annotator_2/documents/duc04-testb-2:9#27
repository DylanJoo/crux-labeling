Hodler alleged malpractices in the bid campaigns for the 1996, 1998, 2000, and 2002 games. He claimed that a group of four agents, including one IOC member, have been involved in promising votes for payment, with prices ranging from $500,000 to $1 million for a bloc of votes. Hodler also stated that the agents then charge the winning city \"something like $3 million to $5 million.\" He believed that agents had been buying and selling votes for the past 10 years."}
