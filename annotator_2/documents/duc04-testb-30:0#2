The opposition claims the grenade attack was staged as an excuse to begin the crackdown. The CPP stated that the leaders of the demonstrations were responsible for the consequences of the protest, referring to the deadly violence as \"minor incidents.\" The ruling party also reminded the United States of its past support for the Khmer Rouge, which was responsible for the deaths of up to 2 million people during its rule of Cambodia. The CPP accused U.S. policymakers of not taking timely action to save the Cambodian people from the Khmer Rouge and of making unjust accusations against those who led the struggle to liberate the people from genocide."}
