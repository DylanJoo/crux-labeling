{"id": "duc04-testb-30:8#25", "contents": "Rainsy's concerns stem from the tumultuous events following last July's election, which saw massive street demonstrations organized by the opposition after Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party narrowly won. The opposition alleged widespread fraud and intimidation, refusing to accept the results of the polls. Fearing for their safety, Rainsy and his then-ally Prince Norodom Ranariddh led an exodus of opposition lawmakers out of Cambodia after parliament was ceremonially opened in late September. Ranariddh has since returned and struck a deal with Hun Sen to form a coalition government, with Hun Sen as prime minister and Ranariddh as president of the National Assembly."}
