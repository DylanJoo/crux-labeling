Deniz Baykal, the leader of the center-left Republican party, has threatened to withdraw his party's support from Yilmaz's minority government unless the premier steps down immediately. Two opposition parties have also vowed to press for a motion to censure the government. The allegations were made by businessman Korkmaz Yigit, who claimed that Yilmaz and Economy Minister Gunes Taner had encouraged him to buy the state-run bank Turkbank and offered him loans from other state banks to ensure his bid was the highest."}
