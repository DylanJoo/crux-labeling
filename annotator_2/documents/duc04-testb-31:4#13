{"id": "duc04-testb-31:4#13", "contents": "The controversy surrounding the privatization of Turkbank began when an audio tape surfaced, supposedly featuring a conversation between Yigit and mobster Alaattin Cakici. On the tape, Cakici was heard assuring Yigit that he would fend off rival bidders. Yigit has since claimed that Yilmaz and Taner were aware of Cakici's involvement in the bidding process but urged him to proceed with the bid anyway. Yilmaz has denied this, stating that he only became aware of Yigit's ties to Cakici after the tender had been awarded. The government suspended the privatization of Turkbank last month, and Yigit's purchase of the bank for $600 million in August is now under scrutiny."}
