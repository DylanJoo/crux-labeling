{"id": "duc04-testb-31:5#17", "contents": "Turkey's parliament is deeply divided by longstanding animosity between its center-left and center-right parties. The previous government, led by Yilmaz, collapsed in November amid allegations of ties to organized crime and interference with the sale of a state bank. By tradition, Demirel should have asked the leader of Parliament's largest party to form a new government, but he broke with custom to prevent the Islamic-oriented Virtue Party from coming to power. The Turkish military strongly opposes the return of an Islamic-led government, having pressured the only previous Islamic-led government out of power for failing to adhere to the country's secular traditions."}
