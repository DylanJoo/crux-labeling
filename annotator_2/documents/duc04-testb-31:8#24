However, the Islamic-oriented Virtue Party has withheld immediate support, reportedly holding out for a number of Cabinet seats that reflect its standing as the largest party in parliament. Erez has denied that the two had discussed Cabinet posts, stating that he is trying to form a coalition government that would include Cabinet members from several parties, including Virtue. The coalition would run the country only until parliamentary elections set for April."}
