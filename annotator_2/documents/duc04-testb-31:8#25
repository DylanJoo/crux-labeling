Erez opened talks with various party leaders on Monday, receiving support from center-right leader Mesut Yilmaz, who said his party supported Erez as long as he had Ecevit's backing. Ecevit also expressed his support, stating that as long as the secular, democratic regime was taken into account, his party would do its best to help form the new government and ensure it gets a vote of confidence."}
