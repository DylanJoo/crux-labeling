Microsoft had always planned to fold browser technology into its operating system, but Netscape's rapid rise accelerated its timing. In December 1995, Bill Gates announced that Microsoft would not only integrate its browser into Windows but also give it away for free. This caught the industry by surprise, including Colbeth, and had a significant impact on Spyglass. The company had licensed its technology to 82 other companies, generating $20 million in revenue per year, but this revenue stream vanished within a year as smaller Internet software companies went out of business and big customers shifted to Microsoft's free browser."}
