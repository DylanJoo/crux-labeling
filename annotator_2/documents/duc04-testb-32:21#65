In 1995, Microsoft and the government reached a consent agreement in which the company promised to stop forcing PC makers to buy one copy of a Microsoft operating system for every computer sold _ instead of one for every computer on which the operating system, MS-DOS or Windows, was installed. The company also agreed to stop tying the sale of one software product to the sale of another. The charges in the present suit are similar in many ways."}
