The book, \"Competing on Internet Time: Lessons from Netscape and Its Battle with Microsoft,\" is written by Michael A. Cusumano of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Sloan School of Management and David B. Yoffie of the Harvard business school. Microsoft contends that its industry-standard Windows operating system and its Internet Explorer browser are a single integrated product. However, the government and 20 states suing Microsoft assert that they are two separate products that Microsoft bundled together to gain an unfair advantage over Netscape Communications Corp. in the market for software used to browse the Internet's World Wide Web."}
