The act has been amended several times, increasing the severity of penalties for individuals and corporations convicted of violating it. The act has been used to file both criminal and civil suits, with the Microsoft case being an example of the latter. In this case, the government is seeking to change the company's business practices rather than imposing financial penalties."}
