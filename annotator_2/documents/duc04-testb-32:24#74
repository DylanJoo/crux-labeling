It states that individuals who monopolize or attempt to monopolize any part of trade or commerce among states or with foreign nations are guilty of a misdemeanor. The punishment for this offense is similar to that in Section 1, with a fine of up to $5,000, imprisonment of up to one year, or both. This provision ensures that no single entity can dominate the market and stifle competition."}
