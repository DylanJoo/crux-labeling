The law's impact was uncertain, but it was seen as a way to appease the masses. The act's language was criticized as \"impenetrable,\" earning it the nickname the Swiss Cheese Act. However, by the early 1900s, the political climate had changed, and the growing antagonism towards trusts was tapped by President Theodore Roosevelt, who became a trustbuster. The Sherman Act was used to attack perceived exploitation and the aggregation of power, with the model trust being Standard Oil."}
