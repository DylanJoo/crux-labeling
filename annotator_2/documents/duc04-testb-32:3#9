{"id": "duc04-testb-32:3#9", "contents": "The Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890, the legal tool used by the government in its assault on Microsoft Corp., is a brief, vague, and malleable statute. Its provisions, Sections 1 and 2, mention \"conspiracy,\" \"restraint of trade,\" and \"attempt to monopolize,\" but never use the term \"competition.\" The act was passed as a nod to a popular backlash against the rise of industrial trusts in oil, steel, and railroads, which were viewed as vehicles of concentrated power by farmers, laborers, and small-business owners."}
