A nerd perhaps, but also a self-styled visionary who almost single-handedly unlocked the power of the personal computer. However, in a Washington courtroom, the Justice Department began painting a different, darker portrait of Gates. The government is depicting Gates as a Nixonian schemer who will go to almost any length to crush his competition. Product innovation, the suit argues, is not a sufficient weapon for Gates. The government is using snippets of Gates' videotaped deposition and e-mail messages to establish a pattern of threats and offers of payments by the Microsoft chairman."}
