{"id": "duc04-testb-32:8#26", "contents": "The Microsoft-Netscape meeting highlights the complex relationship between Microsoft and other companies in the software industry. As the industry's gatekeeper, Microsoft's operating system is the platform on which all other software programs must run. This creates a blurred line between competition and cooperation, as companies like Netscape require Microsoft's cooperation to compete against it. The government's suit against Microsoft centers on this issue, with Microsoft's Chris Jones testifying that the company intended to persuade Netscape not to compete in the platform space. However, Microsoft disputes this interpretation, arguing that it was simply clarifying its position and offering a partnership to Netscape if it stayed on the applications side of the operating system."}
