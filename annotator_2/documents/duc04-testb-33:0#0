Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu named Sharon foreign minister on Friday, effectively putting the hard-liner in charge of negotiating Israel's final borders with the Palestinians. This appointment has raised concerns given Sharon's past actions, particularly his role in Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon."}
