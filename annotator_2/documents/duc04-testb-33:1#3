{"id": "duc04-testb-33:1#3", "contents": "Ariel Sharon's appointment as the Israeli foreign minister has been met with widespread criticism in the Arab world. A Syrian newspaper, Tishrin, described the appointment as \"the bullet of mercy\" for the Middle East peace process, implying that it would bring an end to the stalled negotiations. Sharon's role in Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon and his indirect responsibility for the massacre of Palestinian refugees at two Beirut camps have made him a contentious figure in the region. His appointment has raised concerns about Israel's commitment to the peace process, with many Arabs viewing him as a hard-liner who is unlikely to make concessions."}
