However, as foreign minister, he will be directly involved in the final status talks with the Palestinians, which will follow the signing of an interim peace agreement. Sharon has expressed his disdain for Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, stating that he would never shake his hand. The reaction to Sharon's appointment has been mixed, with some Palestinian leaders and Israeli leftists expressing concern, while others are willing to \"forget history\" if it leads to a peace deal."}
