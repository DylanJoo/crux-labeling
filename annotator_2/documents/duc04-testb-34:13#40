Despite its initial success with the Navigator browser software, Netscape was eventually forced to distribute it for free as Microsoft's browser technology caught up. Since then, Netscape has focused on advertising and transaction fees from its Netcenter Web site and selling industrial-strength software to corporations. AOL believes it has the expertise to increase revenues from Netscape's Web site and accelerate its software sales, helped by Sun's programmers and vast corporate sales force. The combined revenues of the three companies would exceed $12.4 billion, with Microsoft's revenues totaling over $14 billion."}
