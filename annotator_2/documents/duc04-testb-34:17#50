However, analysts question whether AOL can deliver the consistency, focus, and follow-through that corporate customers demand. Robert Chatham, a senior analyst with Forrester Research, notes that AOL is not the first company that comes to mind when thinking of business-quality software. Keeping Netscape as a separate unit and offering e-commerce services in partnership with Sun may not enhance AOL's credibility, making it appear as a \"menage a trois\" of AOL, Netscape, and Sun."}
