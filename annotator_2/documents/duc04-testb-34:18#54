However, the company has been most competitive in securing smaller, more technical projects rather than larger, more strategic assignments. According to Robert Gett, the chief executive of Viant, Netscape's approach is often seen as self-serving, with the company promoting its own software as the best solution. In contrast, Viant positions itself as a more neutral partner, helping customers to decide which platform is best for their business needs."}
