A finance official was attacked earlier this week, a top banker was killed last week, and an aide to Russia's parliament speaker was shot in the head last month. These incidents have raised concerns about the safety and security of public figures in the city. Starovoitova's death is the latest in a string of violent attacks, and an investigation into her killing is likely to be launched soon."}
