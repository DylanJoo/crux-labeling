{"id": "duc04-testb-35:6#20", "contents": "Starovoitova's murder had all the traits of a contract murder, an increasingly common crime in Russia. Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov on Monday used Starovoitova's killing as an occasion to lambast the government for its inability to contain soaring crime. ``That's a result of the (government's) catastrophic policy aimed at the destruction of the state and the nation,'' he said. President Boris Yeltsin called Starovoitova a ``comrade'' and said he would personally monitor the investigation into her killing. Starovoitova is scheduled to be buried on Tuesday at the Nikolskoye cemetery in St. Petersburg."}
