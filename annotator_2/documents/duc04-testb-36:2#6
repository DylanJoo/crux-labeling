The president's office stated that he has decided to send Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov to the November summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic Forum in Kuala Lumpur, citing that the summit primarily deals with financial issues. However, sources in Primakov's office suggested that the cancellation was due to concerns about the long flight's potential impact on Yeltsin's health. Yeltsin has been suffering from bronchitis and a cold this week, which forced him to cut short a visit to Central Asia on Monday. He was spending Friday at a country home outside Moscow after defying doctor's orders and working in the Kremlin for the past two days. Aides reported the president's condition as \"satisfactory.\""}
