In an interview with the British Broadcasting Corp., Luzhkov stopped short of calling on Yeltsin to step down but expressed concerns about the president's ability to govern due to his poor health. Luzhkov has always been supportive of Yeltsin and had never before questioned the president's health or ability to lead. \"According to our constitution, the president himself has to say he is not able to work,\" Luzhkov said. \"And because of (Yeltsin's) poor health, he is no longer able to give the country as much time as it demands.\" Luzhkov's spokesman Mikhail Solomentsev refused to elaborate on the statement."}
