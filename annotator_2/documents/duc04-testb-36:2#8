Each new ailment rekindles speculation about his fitness to govern. The president and his doctors say Yeltsin has no serious health problems and will serve out the final two years of his term. Despite this, Luzhkov's comments have raised concerns about Yeltsin's ability to lead the country effectively. Yeltsin is still planning to attend an Oct. 27-28 summit of European nations in Vienna, according to his office. Government sources also said that a visit to Austria later this month is still going forward, despite earlier reports of cancellation."}
