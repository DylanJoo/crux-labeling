His spokesman, Dmitry Yakushkin, attributed Yeltsin's condition to a cold and the stress of a difficult week. Yeltsin, 67, appeared stiff and stumbled during a public ceremony, requiring support from Uzbek President Islam Karimov. Despite this, the two leaders held a one-on-one summit as scheduled. Yeltsin's trip to Uzbekistan and Kazakstan is his first high-profile foray since an economic crisis hit Russia in August. He has spent most of the last two months out of the public eye, holding meetings at his country home outside Moscow."}
