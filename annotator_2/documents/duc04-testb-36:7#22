The crisis was triggered by Russia's devaluation of its currency and default on some of its debt in August. Yeltsin is expected to discuss economic agreements, fighting smuggling and crime, and expanding cultural ties with his counterparts. He will also meet with Kazak President Nursultan Nazarbayev to sign agreements on economic, science, and technical cooperation, as well as combating drug trafficking."}
