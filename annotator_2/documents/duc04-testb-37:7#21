The violence was in retaliation for the burning and ransacking of 22 churches by Muslim mobs in Jakarta on November 22, which resulted in 14 deaths. A rampaging crowd also burned down a market and a Muslim school, while troops and riot police patrolled the streets to maintain order. Despite the chaos, there were no immediate reports of serious injuries or arrests. The conflict between Muslims and Christians continued into the night, with the city of Kupang, where the violence occurred, being predominantly Christian."}
