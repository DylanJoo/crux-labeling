Lebanese President Elias Hrawi traveled to Damascus for a summit meeting with Syrian President Hafez Assad to show Lebanon's support for Syria. The Lebanese government has called for a \"diplomatic dialogue\" to defuse the tension, with Prime Minister Rafik Hariri stating that his country backs Syria in the dispute. The tension was triggered when Turkish President Suleyman Demirel warned Damascus that Turkey would not allow Syria to continue sheltering Kurdish rebels. Syria has denied the allegations, and Lebanese Foreign Minister Faris Bweiz has reiterated that measures were taken over a year ago to stop the activities of any PKK members in Syria and Lebanon."}
