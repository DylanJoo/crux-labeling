{"id": "duc04-testb-39:19#58", "contents": "The Republicans' new 223-211 majority (assuming a Democrat leading in Oregon holds on to win), with one independent, amounted to the smallest congressional majority since the Republican-controlled Congress of 1953, the last time Republicans controlled the House until they captured it again in 1994. With attention now shifting to the House Judiciary Committee and its impeachment inquiry, Rep. Henry Hyde told fellow Republicans on the panel in a conference call Wednesday that the only witness Republicans were likely to call would be the independent counsel, Kenneth Starr. Hyde, the chairman, told lawmakers he hoped to have the committee vote on possible articles of impeachment by Thanksgiving, an act that would take the issue out of his hands and put it into Gingrich's. Committee Democrats declined comment Wednesday until they could discuss Hyde's plan among themselves."}
