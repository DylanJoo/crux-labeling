Forbes described Gingrich's conference call as statesmanlike at first, but eventually descending into anger and blame towards House conservatives, whom he accused of \"cannibalism\" and \"blackmail.\" Gingrich also acknowledged his own role in bringing negative attention to himself and the party, stating that his \"controversial nature\" would overshadow any successes they might have. His resignation has sparked a scramble to replace him, with Rep. Robert L. Livingston of Louisiana and Rep. Bill Archer of Texas already announcing their candidacy for the speakership."}
