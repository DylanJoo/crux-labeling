One resigned, another challenged Mahathir for leadership of the ruling party and lost, and the third, Anwar Ibrahim, was fired on September 2. Anwar was deemed morally unfit for office and was subsequently detained as a national security risk. He was also charged with illegal homosexual acts and corruption. Anwar had been leading a nationwide campaign against Mahathir before his detention."}
