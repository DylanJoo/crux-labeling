The base, about 30 miles south of Seoul, is one of two major American airfields in Korea, housing 7,500 airmen. Before flying to the base, Clinton attended church on an Army base in Seoul, visited a firing range, and promoted a private to specialist. He also led the troops in a round of \"Happy Birthday\" for a sergeant major who turned 45 on Sunday. Clinton's visit was part of his five-day trip to Japan and South Korea, which will conclude with a visit to Guam before returning to Washington on Monday night."}
