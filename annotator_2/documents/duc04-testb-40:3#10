He held a roundtable discussion with business leaders to hear their prescriptions for putting the nation's economy back on track. Clinton praised South Korea's progress in recovering from its financial crisis, but also mentioned recent tensions over Asian steel exports to the United States, which have skyrocketed this year at great cost to domestic U.S. steelmakers. Japanese steel is the biggest problem, but South Korean steel exports are also on the rise. Clinton emphasized that the U.S. economy could tolerate increased imports if they are not concentrated in just a few industries and if the result is that the Asian economies begin to recover."}
