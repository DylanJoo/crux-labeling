President Kim Dae-jung, appearing with Clinton at a news conference, pledged to \"spare no effort in supporting the U.S. endeavor\" to resolve the nuclear question. He called for full access for U.S. inspectors at a North Korean underground facility and said the North must not develop missiles. Clinton acknowledged that U.S. intelligence officials are not yet certain that the suspicious underground construction project in North Korea is nuclear-related. However, he emphasized that the North risks closing the door on cooperation if it refuses a U.S. inspection of the site."}
