Kim Deog-ryong revealed that communist North Korea may be secretly producing plutonium and has more hidden underground nuclear facilities than initially suspected. According to Kim, he received information that two underground facilities, captured on US spy satellite photos, are believed to be nuclear plants. One of these facilities is thought to already be producing plutonium, while the other is expected to be operational in four to six years, with the capability to produce enough plutonium for 10 nuclear bombs starting around 2004."}
