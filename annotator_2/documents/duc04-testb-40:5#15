{"id": "duc04-testb-40:5#15", "contents": "Historically, the United States has maintained an unofficial list of foreign leaders who it believes would greatly contribute to peace, security, or the American agenda by stepping down. This list has included dictators, unfriendly authoritarians, and consistently annoying allies. In the past, leaders such as those in Iran and Guatemala in the 1950s, Diem and Sukarno in the 1960s, and Salvador Allende Gossens in Chile in the 1970s have made the list. Although diplomatic etiquette has usually discouraged publicly announcing this list, the Clinton administration recently spoke out against two leaders, Saddam Hussein of Iraq and Mahathir Mohamed of Malaysia."}
