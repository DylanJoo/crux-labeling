According to Richard Feinberg, a professor at the University of California at San Diego, the decision to push for a leader's removal is often based on strategic concerns and the presence of domestic opposition. In the case of Mahathir, his opposition to Washington's economic agenda and his human rights record, particularly the treatment of his finance minister Anwar Ibrahim, have contributed to his shift from a tolerated authoritarian to one who has outlived his usefulness. The administration's stance on Mahathir highlights the complexities of determining when it is acceptable to call for a foreign leader's removal."}
