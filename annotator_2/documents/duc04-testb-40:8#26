{"id": "duc04-testb-40:8#26", "contents": "The Clinton administration is seeking to inspect a construction site in North Korea that is believed to be the beginnings of a nuclear weapons plant. Clinton expressed deep concern over this site, as well as North Korea's test firing of a missile over Japan in August. However, the administration is taking a different approach towards North Korea than towards Iraq, partly at the urging of Kim, who is pursuing a \"sunshine policy\" of engagement with the North. Clinton became animated when describing a film he saw on his hotel television of a cruise ship carrying South Koreans on a tour into the North, arguing that Kim's policy presented North Korea with a great opportunity to gain advantage, power, and wealth."}
