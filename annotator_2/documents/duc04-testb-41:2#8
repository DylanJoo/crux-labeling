{"id": "duc04-testb-41:2#8", "contents": "The collapse of Prodi's government has sparked a political crisis, with President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro consulting with leaders to determine whether Prodi can form a new government. If not, the president may turn to another leader or call for early elections. However, parties of all political stripes may be reluctant to push for elections, as opinion polls suggest that voters are not enamored with either the center-right opposition parties or the governing majority. Prodi's defeat has been attributed to the treachery of a single member of his coalition, Silvio Liotta, who voted against him. Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini has announced that Liotta will be expelled from the Italian Renewal Party."}
