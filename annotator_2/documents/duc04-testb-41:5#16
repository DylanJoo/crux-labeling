{"id": "duc04-testb-41:5#16", "contents": "Prime Minister Romano Prodi's coalition is a loose alliance of the former Communists, known as the Democratic Party of the Left, and Prodi's moderate Catholic-oriented followers. It is supported by Communist Refounding, a fringe group of hard-line leftists who broke with the mainstream Communists after they overhauled the party following the collapse of Communism in Eastern Europe. The alliance has held since 1996, mainly due to the desire to meet the fiscal requirements to allow Italy to adopt the single European currency. As the January 1 date approaches for the introduction of the euro, Italy must cut its key lending rates to bring them in line with those of bigger European neighbors, like Germany."}
