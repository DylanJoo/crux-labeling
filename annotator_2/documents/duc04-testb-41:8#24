{"id": "duc04-testb-41:8#24", "contents": "Italian politics have long been characterized by complex feuds and shifting alliances. This tradition may have temporarily saved the government of Prime Minister Romano Prodi. A leader of the hard-line Marxist faction, known as the Communist Refounding Party, resigned in protest over the party's decision to reject the government's 1999 budget. This rejection put Prodi's slender majority in Parliament at risk. The chairman of the Communist Refounding Party, Armando Cossuta, stated that Prodi's majority no longer exists, but emphasized the need to save the government and avoid crisis. Cossuta was unwilling to join the hard-line wing of his party in withdrawing support from Prodi, fearing being blamed for torpedoing the first leftist Italian government in 50 years."}
