{"id": "duc04-testb-42:11#34", "contents": "Verleger's outlook for the oil industry is mixed, with low prices likely to persist for the next six months to a year. However, he expects a reduction in investment in exploration and production to lead to a supply shortage, strengthening the hands of OPEC countries and potentially driving prices up to $20 a barrel in the next 18 months. In the longer term, Verleger predicts consolidation in the industry, with the number of big oil companies shrinking to five or six. While he believes oil companies are still a worthwhile investment, he advises caution and notes that investors should not expect to make money in the short term."}
