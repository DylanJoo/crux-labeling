{"id": "duc04-testb-42:12#36", "contents": "Analysts predict that if the two giants reach an agreement, it is likely to be in the form of a takeover by Exxon of Mobil, given Exxon's larger size and financial strength. Huge cuts in duplicate staff from both companies, which employ 122,700 people, are expected. Adam Sieminski, an oil analyst for BT Alex. Brown, estimates that the companies would probably make cuts to save about $3 billion to $5 billion a year. The transaction would likely be an exchange of Mobil shares for Exxon shares, with Exxon offering a premium of about 15 to 20 percent over its price prior to Monday, when speculation of an Exxon takeover of Mobil first circulated. Based on Mobil's $75.25 share price a week ago, a takeover of the company would be worth about $70 billion."}
