British Petroleum bought Standard Oil of Ohio in the 1970s, and Amoco was once Standard Oil of Indiana. The break-up of Standard Oil and the resulting competition has often been cited as a precedent for the current antitrust action against Microsoft. Chernow sees no reason why allowing an Exxon acquisition of Mobil to go through should suggest more leniency for Microsoft. ``Exxon would not be obviously larger than its leading competitors, the way Microsoft is,'' he said. In the energy business today, he added, ``there are other large dinosaurs that stalk that particular jungle.''"}
