If successful, the combined entity would become the largest U.S. company in terms of revenue. The talks were reported separately by The Financial Times of London and Bloomberg News. The possible merger comes at a time when oil prices have sunk to their lowest levels in almost 12 years, putting pressure on oil companies to cut costs. A combined Exxon and Mobil would be bigger than Royal Dutch/Shell Group, the world's largest oil company by revenue."}
