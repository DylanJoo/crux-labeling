As a result, they have had to focus on exploration areas in other regions, such as the deep waters of the Gulf of Mexico, West Africa, and parts of Asia. However, this type of exploration is extremely expensive, and even when a significant field is discovered, it requires massive investment to bring it into production. For example, platforms can cost over $1 billion to construct."}
