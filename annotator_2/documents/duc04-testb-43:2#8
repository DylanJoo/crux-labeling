In a recent affidavit, the source acknowledged pleading guilty to terrorism charges in the United States and described taking an oath of allegiance to follow bin Laden's orders. The source also provided a detailed account of bin Laden's group, including its history and inner workings, and recounted private statements by bin Laden encouraging attacks on U.S. troops and citizens stationed in the Middle East and Africa."}
