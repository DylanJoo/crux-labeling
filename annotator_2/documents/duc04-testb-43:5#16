However, U.S. intelligence officials believe bin Laden was in the camp on the day of the attack, but left unscathed before the missiles hit. At least one of his senior lieutenants may have died in the attack, with total casualties estimated to be between 50 and 100. Administration spokesmen have drawn a distinction between attempting to kill a specific person like bin Laden and attacking a group of people who command a terrorist organization."}
