A daring raid into Afghanistan to capture bin Laden was considered last spring, and the White House drafted a legal justification for military attacks against a terrorist leadership. This review provided the legal basis for the August operation, which did not violate the presidential order banning assassinations. The review has been seen as a precedent for future operations in similar circumstances, and has sparked intense debate over the years about the interpretation of the 1976 executive order."}
