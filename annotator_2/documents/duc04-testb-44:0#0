British Prime Minister Tony Blair stated that the decision is not for the British or Spanish governments, but rather a legal matter between two systems united by an extradition treaty. Similarly, Spanish Foreign Ministry spokesman Joaquin Perez emphasized that the government should not have an opinion on the extradition. The detention of Pinochet by British police, acting on an international arrest warrant from Spanish judge Baltasar Garzon, has been welcomed by human rights activists worldwide but has sparked protests from the Chilean government and fears of damaging economic relations."}
