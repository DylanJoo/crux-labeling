The British government insists that Pinochet's case will be decided by the courts and not politically, but the diplomatic and judicial entanglements involve at least five governments. The political and legal imbroglio could end if Britain's home secretary decides to release Pinochet on \"compassionate grounds\" due to his age and failing health. Pinochet's lawyers have argued that he is ill and that his age and health should be taken into account in the extradition proceedings."}
