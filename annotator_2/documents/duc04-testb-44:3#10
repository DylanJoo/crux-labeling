In London, about 100 Chilean demonstrators gathered outside the hospital, chanting and waving placards bearing portraits of those who disappeared in Chile. In Santiago, Chile, dueling demonstrations took place, with some pro-Pinochet protesters trying to break through police lines into the British embassy. The Chilean government has sent a delegation to London to argue for Pinochet's release, while the former dictator's family has vowed to hire top attorneys to defend him. Pinochet's son, Augusto, has stated that the family will hire \"the best legal team available in London\" to defend his father."}
