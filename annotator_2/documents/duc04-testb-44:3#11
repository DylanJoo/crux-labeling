{"id": "duc04-testb-44:3#11", "contents": "The British government has 40 days to formally apply for Pinochet's extradition to Spain, with the final decision lying with Home Secretary Jack Straw. Pinochet has been accused of running a ruthless regime marked by disappearances and deaths of political opponents, with a total of 4,299 political opponents dying or disappearing during his term. The arrest warrant refers only to questioning about allegations that he killed Spaniards in Chile between 1973 and 1983. Pinochet has immunity from prosecution in Chile as a senator-for-life, but this does not apply in Britain. The case has sparked a diplomatic row between Britain, Chile, and Spain, with the Chilean government arguing that it is a matter for Chilean courts to try events that occurred in Chile."}
