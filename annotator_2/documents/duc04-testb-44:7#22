During his time in power, Pinochet was a frequent visitor to the UK, where he was welcomed by the Conservative government. He was the only Latin American leader to support Britain in its 1982 war against Argentina to reclaim the Falkland Islands. Pinochet and Thatcher also shared similar economic policies. The current visit has sparked controversy, with Chile's ambassador delivering a formal protest to the Foreign Office, claiming that Britain has violated Pinochet's diplomatic immunity."}
