Assistant U.S. Attorney Patrick Fitzgerald suggested that the government may be willing to make some modifications to the restrictions. The three defendants, Wadih el Hage, Mohammed Saddiq Odeh, and Mohamed Rashed Daoud al-'Owhali, have all pleaded not guilty to the charges against them. Odeh and al-'Owhali have been charged with separate counts of murder in the deaths of over 200 people in the embassy attacks in Kenya and Tanzania on August 7. Bin Laden, who is believed to be the mastermind behind the attacks, remains at large and is thought to be living in Afghanistan under the protection of the Taliban."}
