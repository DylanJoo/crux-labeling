The Taliban, who rule 90 percent of Afghanistan, have also expressed their support for bin Laden, describing him as a \"respected guest\" who will not be extradited. The Taliban have set up a judicial inquiry to investigate evidence of bin Laden's involvement in terrorist activity, but it is unclear what actions they will take if the evidence warrants prosecution."}
