{"id": "duc04-testb-45:8#24", "contents": "On Wednesday, a federal grand jury in Manhattan indicted Osama bin Laden, a Saudi exile, on 238 counts of conspiring to bomb two U.S. embassies in Africa in August and committing acts of terrorism against Americans abroad. The government immediately announced two rewards of $5 million each for information leading to the arrest or conviction of bin Laden and Muhammad Atef, his chief military commander. Bin Laden is believed to be living in Afghanistan under the protection of the Taliban, while Atef's whereabouts are unknown. The new indictment supersedes an earlier one issued in June, which included similar but less detailed charges against bin Laden."}
