{"id": "duc04-testb-46:1#5", "contents": "The umpires were so human in the American League playoffs that it happened from time to time to time to time. The Cleveland Indians suffered the brunt of the fallibility of the umpires. ``We had a highlight reel of umpires getting knocked down by baseballs,'' general manager John Hart said after the Indians' final game against the Yankees. ``The umpires didn't lose the game for us, but we had our share of controversies in two playoff series with umpires.'' The game today is faster than it used to be, and the umpires have to be sharper. Maybe Garcia, Dale Scott and Tim Tschida from the American League, and Jerry Crawford, Dana DeMuth and Mark Hirschbeck from the National League, will be as sharp as an 18th century French guillotine in these four to seven games. The umpires should let the players make the errors and the managers the bad decisions. Then everyone will talk about the players and managers and not the umpires."}
