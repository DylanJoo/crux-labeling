However, two crucial hits in a big inning changed everything on Saturday night in Game 1 of the World Series. With the Yankees trailing San Diego 5-2 in the seventh inning, Knoblauch hit a three-run home run to tie the score, and five batters later, Martinez smashed a grand slam. The seven-run explosion propelled the Yankees to a 9-6 victory in the series opener, in front of 56,712 fans at Yankee Stadium."}
