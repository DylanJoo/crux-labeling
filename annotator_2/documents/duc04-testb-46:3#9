{"id": "duc04-testb-46:3#9", "contents": "Langston and Martinez were engaged in a tense battle at the plate. With two strikes and two balls, Langston threw a pitch near the outside corner that he thought was a strike, but Garcia called it a ball. Langston glared, snapping at the return throw, and it was clear that he was frustrated. With the bases loaded and a 3-2 count, Langston knew he had to throw a \"cookie\" - a pitch over the middle of the plate that Martinez could hit. Martinez took advantage of the opportunity, hitting the ball into the upper deck in right field for a grand slam. The crowd erupted, and Martinez was greeted with chants and applause as he rounded the bases."}
