The team's fan base is a cross-section of the county, with fans from all walks of life, including those from across the border in Mexico. The Padres have a significant following in Tijuana, with the team operating the first major league baseball souvenir store in the city. Fans like Carlos Carrion, who brings his sons to the stadium, appreciate the opportunity to watch the players and learn from their character and work ethic. The Padres' ticket office estimates that over 15,000 fans in the 65,000-seat stadium are Latin Americans from San Diego, Baja California, or the state of Sonora."}
