The 36-year-old outfielder said doctors told him he will need one treatment of at least one hour a week. Strawberry remained optimistic about his future and said that the discovery of cancer in one lymph node did not worry him, as it was only one out of 36 and the cancer had not spread. He also spoke with Eric Davis about the chemotherapy treatment, who told him it's not as bad as some people say."}
