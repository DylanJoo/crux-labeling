According to the Interfax news agency, Cochetel was freed about two minutes into the operation, but a longer firefight broke out between the kidnappers and Russian security forces. The official was unharmed, but he reported that three of the kidnappers had been killed. Footage of the operation broadcast by Russia's NTV television station showed Cochetel lying face-down, hand-cuffed, behind a white van, with Russian security officers standing over him protectively."}
