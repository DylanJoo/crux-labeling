This development is seen as a clear indication that Chinese leaders intend to suppress the formation of a would-be opposition party, the China Democracy Party. According to Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao, Xu and Qin are suspected of involvement in activities that breach relevant provisions of the criminal laws of the People's Republic of China.
