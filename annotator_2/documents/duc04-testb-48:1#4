Dissidents in and out of China rose to Xu's defense, with over a dozen activists announcing that they would begin fasts in support of Xu and another leader of the China Democratic Party, Qin Yongmin, who was arrested in his home in Wuhan. Almost 200 dissidents signed a letter to the Chinese government protesting the detentions. Three other Democratic Party organizers were also detained, although two of them were released early on Wednesday."}
