Xu's and Qin's trouble likely stems from their efforts to gain recognition for the China Democratic Party, a loose network of pro-democracy activists that was formed this year. They had become increasingly aggressive and defiant in their attempts to register the party with the government, submitting repeated applications despite local authorities declaring the concept of an opposition party illegal."}
