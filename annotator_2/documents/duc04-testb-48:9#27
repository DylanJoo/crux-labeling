The two men, leading organizers of a budding opposition political party, face 10 years to life imprisonment if convicted. Despite their families' efforts, court officials have denied a postponement request and police have detained or threatened several lawyers, making it difficult for Qin and Wang to receive adequate representation. Qin's family has pleaded for a postponement, but to no avail. Wang's wife, Hu Jiangxia, is pessimistic about the outcome, saying that the government has already decided on the verdict."}
