Qin, a 20-year democracy campaigner, and Wang, a student leader of the 1989 Tiananmen Square democracy movement, are among the most influential members of China's dissident community. A third prominent dissident, Xu Wenli, was also arrested but has not yet been charged. The ruling Communist Party appears to be determined to crush challenges to its monopoly on power, and the trials of Qin and Wang are seen as a key test of its resolve."}
