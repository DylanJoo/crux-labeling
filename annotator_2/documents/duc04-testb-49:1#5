Primakov has since distanced himself from the talk of currency controls, stating that the document published by Kommersant Daily was just one of six possible plans. Despite this, many believe that the plan represents the basic thrust of the government's thinking, and Primakov's call for greater state regulation and an expansion of the money supply has been seen as a sign of his support for the plan's themes. The IMF's willingness to provide aid has also been linked to Primakov's economic strategy, with the prime minister arguing that unpopular measures would be necessary without the fund's support."}
