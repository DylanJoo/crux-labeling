The government's press service reported that they focused on ways to maintain the hryvna's value at 3.5 to the US dollar through the end of the year. The hryvna has been trading at 3.4 to the dollar, but trading has been limited. There are concerns that the hryvna will continue to decline, leading Ukrainians to stock up on essential goods to protect their rapidly devaluing currency."}
