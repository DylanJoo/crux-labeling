The stock market has continued to decline since the crisis hit on August 17, with a 5% drop on Friday. Additionally, tax collection was down in September due to the collapse of the banking system, with revenues totaling 14.3 billion rubles ($875 million), 700 million rubles ($43 million) less than expected. The government aims to reverse this trend by increasing taxes for oil and gas companies, but this idea is expected to face resistance in the lower house of Russia's parliament."}
