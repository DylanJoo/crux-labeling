{"id": "duc04-testb-49:5#15", "contents": "Russia is facing a major crisis as its postal system has come to a grinding halt. The Post Office, a vital institution in the country, is broke and unable to pay its debts to the Railway Ministry, which has refused to carry mail until the bills are paid. This has resulted in a massive backlog of letters, newspapers, and parcels, with over 1,000 mail cars stuck in limbo. The situation is so dire that post offices in Moscow and other cities have stopped accepting out-of-town mail, except for areas that can be reached by truck. Delivery schedules are weeks, if not months, behind, and the public is growing increasingly frustrated."}
