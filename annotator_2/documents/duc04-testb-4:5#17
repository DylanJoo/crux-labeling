He pledged in a tough inauguration speech to clean up the graft-riddled administration. The British-trained general made his name rebuilding the army after it disintegrated in the civil war. Similar political disputes in Lebanon in the past have been solved only with the intervention of Syria, the main power broker in this country. Damascus supports both Lahoud and Hariri. The two leaders met Friday, but no presidential decree followed, leading to Hariri's decision to decline the invitation to form the next government."}
