The new president will be sworn in Nov. 24, the day Hrawi leaves office. Hrawi has served for nine years, including a three-year extension in 1995 to his six-year term. Lahoud, a Maronite Catholic, will keep alive a 55-year-old tradition under which the president is a Maronite, the prime minister a Sunni Muslim and the Parliament speaker a Shiite Muslim."}
