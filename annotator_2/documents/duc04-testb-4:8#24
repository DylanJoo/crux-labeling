{"id": "duc04-testb-4:8#24", "contents": "Prime Minister Rafik Hariri announced his decision to step down as premier on Monday, citing a dispute with new President Emile Lahoud over the latter's alleged violation of the constitution. Hariri accused Lahoud of unconstitutionally allowing 31 Parliament deputies to authorize him to name a prime minister, instead of naming one themselves. He demanded that Lahoud acknowledge this mistake before reconsidering his position. Hariri's move has created a crisis atmosphere that could impact Lebanon's economic recovery. In an interview with CNN, Hariri stated, \"I'm not a candidate,\" and warned that Lahoud's actions \"might put the country in danger.\" The dispute between the two leaders appears to be over who will have the upper hand in governing the nation."}
