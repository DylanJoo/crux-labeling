Cem has traveled to Rome to attend a meeting of European defense and foreign ministers, where he will press Italy to take a \"serious and fair approach\" to Ocalan's extradition. Ocalan, who founded the Marxist-inspired PKK in 1978, faces the death penalty in Turkey, a fact that has heightened opposition in Italy to his extradition."}
