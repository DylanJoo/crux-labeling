According to Walter Zehetmayr, a senior police officer, \"the political situation requires comprehensive security measures.\" The recent arrest of Abdullah Ocalan, the chief of the Turkish Workers Party PKK, in Rome has prompted concerns about potential large-scale protests by Turkish groups in Vienna. Demirel's visit marks a significant milestone as the first head of state of the Turkish Republic to visit Austria, accompanied by five Cabinet members and a large trade delegation."}
