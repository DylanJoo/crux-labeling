{"id": "duc04-testb-6:11#33", "contents": "Kim Myong Sup, a 23-year-old North Korean man, arrived in Seoul on Wednesday seeking asylum after escaping from his homeland. He had been living in hiding in a \"third country\" since fleeing North Korea last year, according to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade. The ministry typically uses the term \"third country\" to refer to a nation other than the two Koreas, and in this case, it is likely referring to China, with whom North Korea has a treaty requiring the return of defectors. Kim is described as a former athlete, but details about his background and escape method are not available."}
