These defectors, including Kim, have reported severe food and fuel shortages in their homeland. The division between North and South Korea dates back to 1945, when the peninsula was split into the communist North and the capitalist South. The two countries fought the Korean War from 1950 to 1953, but never signed a formal peace treaty, leaving the relationship between them tense and unresolved."}
