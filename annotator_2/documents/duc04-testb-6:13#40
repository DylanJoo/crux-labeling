The areas surveyed cover around 70 percent of the population and were chosen because aid agencies have access to them. The survey found that toddlers aged one to two were the most vulnerable, with 30 percent suffering from acute malnutrition. At this age, malnutrition can have a permanent impact on physical and intellectual growth. UNICEF official Kirsi Madi described the survey as the first \"technically sound survey\" of the problem."}
