Dr. Katona-Apte noted that while she has not seen acute starvation like she has seen in Bangladesh, \"that doesn't mean it can't exist. We're still really limited in what we can see.\" Swedlund rejected the notion that the North Korean military is stealing donated food, and accepted the explanation that some areas are closed for national security reasons.
