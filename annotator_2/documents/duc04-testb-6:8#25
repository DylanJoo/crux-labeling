Ngongi reported that while people generally looked better than during his visit last year, a large part of the population appears weak. Many individuals have been consuming food at a very low level, leading to widespread malnutrition. In one primary school he visited, about 30% of children were absent due to weakness. Ngongi also encountered malnourished children who appeared to be significantly younger than their actual age. Despite these challenges, foreign food aid has played a crucial role in saving lives, with Ngongi attributing the survival of many people to international support."}
