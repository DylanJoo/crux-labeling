{"id": "duc04-testb-7:11#34", "contents": "Conservative Republicans are also concerned about the White House's proposals on family planning, particularly the requirement for federal health plans to cover contraceptives and the ban on overseas family-planning organizations lobbying to change abortion laws in other countries. Rep. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., is seeking changes to the health plan measure, which he believes should allow plans to refuse contraceptive coverage on moral grounds. Democrats, such as Rep. Nita Lowey, D-N.Y., strongly object to this position, arguing that health plans make decisions based on profits, not morals. The question remains whether the White House will insist on keeping the contraceptive coverage in the final package and oppose the moral exception."}
