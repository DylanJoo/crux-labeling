This will use up more than one-quarter of the anticipated budget surplus in the current fiscal year. Another gimmick extended the tax break for Individual Retirement Accounts to couples with incomes from $100,000 to $150,000. This will actually raise a small amount of revenue in the next five years - the period covered by budget accounting - but it will make the picture considerably worse in later years. As hard as it was to negotiate a budget in the bad old days of budget deficits, say the politicians involved, it was exponentially more difficult this year."}
