This year, some members of Congress wanted to use the surplus for a big tax cut. Others wanted to pay off the national debt. Others wanted to spend part of it on medical research, schools and weapons for the Pentagon. Others wanted to spend large sums on highways. Still others wanted to continue cutting government spending. And that was just among the Republicans. The Democrats had their own ideas about the budget, and President Clinton laid down his marker about saving the surplus until a way was found to shore up the Social Security system."}
