{"id": "duc04-testb-8:1#3", "contents": "Israel has announced that it will not withdraw its troops from the West Bank unless the Palestine National Council (PNC) holds a vote to annul clauses of the PLO charter that call for Israel's destruction. This demand comes just a day before U.S. President Bill Clinton's arrival, who helped negotiate the Wye River land-for-security agreement. The Palestinians have stated that they will revoke the clauses by acclamation, not by a vote, when the PNC meets on Monday in Clinton's presence. Israeli officials have emphasized that they will not drop their demand for a vote, with government spokesman Moshe Fogel stating that \"they have to vote in the PNC\" in order for Israel to turn over additional West Bank territory to the Palestinians."}
