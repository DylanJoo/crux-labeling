{"id": "duc04-testb-8:1#5", "contents": "Former Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres has sided with the Palestinians on the issue of the PNC vote, stating that \"they did it once, they did it twice, they don't have to do it again.\" The Palestinians claim that they took all the required steps to revoke the pertinent clauses at a PNC session in Gaza in 1996. However, Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu has said that the PNC never completed the job. The Wye accord does not specifically refer to a vote, but rather states that delegates should \"reaffirm\" the Arafat letter to Clinton. The Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat has expressed hope that Clinton will exert pressure on Israel to keep its obligations under the Wye agreement."}
