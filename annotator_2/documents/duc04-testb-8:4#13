The Cabinet has called on the Palestinians to \"immediately stop the violence and incitement to violence.\" At least two Palestinians were injured in a confrontation outside the Jewish settlement of Ariel, and 27 Palestinians and three Israeli soldiers were injured in similar clashes throughout the West Bank the previous day. The Palestinians deny that they are orchestrating the street fighting, which has grown out of a dispute over Palestinian prisoners held by Israel."}
