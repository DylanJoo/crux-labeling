A pair of astronauts are to make three spacewalks this week, the first on Monday, during which they will hook up electrical and communications cables, remove covers, attach handrails and perform other tasks to get the modules to work as one unit. The most difficult part of Sunday's mating of the $240 million Zarya to the $300 million Unity was bringing them together after the shuttle caught up with the Russian unit. Currie had to use the Canadian-built robot arm to place Zarya on top of Unity without being able to see where the pieces joined."}
