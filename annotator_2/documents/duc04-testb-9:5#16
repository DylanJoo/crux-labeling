The weather, forecast to be iffy, turned out to be fine, and the sky was alight with a nearly full moon. But the length of the so-called launching window was, as planned, unusually short _ only 10 minutes. That brevity was a result of Endeavour's having to rendezvous with a space-station part that Russia put into orbit last month. The show-stopper arose about four minutes before liftoff when the computer in the space shuttle set off a master alarm."}
