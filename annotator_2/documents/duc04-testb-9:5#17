Officials eventually decided that the pressure drop was insignificant, and they resolved to press ahead. But by then it was too late: time had run out for one of the procedures needed to keep the shuttle's fuel supercold. So the countdown was aborted just 19 seconds from blastoff. The six astronauts began to emerge from the shuttle an hour later and ultimately headed for bed to rest up for another attempt early Friday."}
