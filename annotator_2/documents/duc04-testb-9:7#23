The 41-foot, 44,000-pound Zarya module will provide electricity and steering for the fledgling space station until a permanent control module can be launched next summer. The 36-foot, 25,000-pound Unity module will serve as a connecting passageway for future modules. The joined modules will be released from Endeavour once all of the work is completed, marking the beginning of a long process that will require 43 more launches and 159 more spacewalks to assemble the entire orbiting complex."}
