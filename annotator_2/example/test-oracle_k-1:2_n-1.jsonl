Her ability to tie herself to President Obama, a popular figure among black voters, was also seen as a key moment in the debate, as she successfully cast Sanders as insufficiently loyal to the president.

The annual October festival in Yellville sees turkeys hurled from buildings and a plane flying 500 feet above the ground. Disturbed? You're not alone. Tommy Lee is among those to bash the \"sick\" tradition, reports Arkansas Online. Live Science explains the uproar: Domestic turkeys are bred for flightlessness, their bodies too heavy for their wings to get them off the ground. While their wings can slow a descent, there's no guarantee domestic turkeys will survive falls from great heights. The same is true of wild turkeys, which can only fly short distances. Indeed, two turkeys dropped from a plane last year died on impact. At least four turkeys dropped this year were found injured and bleeding, though they've since found refuge at a New York shelter, where they were named John, Ringo, George, and Paul, per the Fairfield Citizen. The town of Yellville technically stopped throwing turkeys in 1989\u2014continuing the Turkey Trot festival started in 1946 with a dance, race, and parade\u2014but local pilots continue to throw turkeys, per the Citizen and Baxter Bulletin. Despite animal activists' appeals, the FAA says it doesn't have the authority to intervene. \"FAA regulations do not specifically prohibit dropping live animals from aircraft, possibly because the authors of the regulation never anticipated that an explicit prohibition would be necessary,\" a rep tells the Huffington Post, adding, \"This does not mean we endorse the practice.\"", "response": "The Turkey Trot festival in Yellville, Arkansas, is a unique annual event that has raised concerns from animal welfare activists due to its association with live turkeys being dropped from small planes. The festival, which has a history dating back to 1952, involves a variety of activities, including a turkey calling contest and a kids' scramble. However, the practice of dropping live turkeys from planes has drawn significant opposition from animal rights groups, who argue that it is inhumane and cruel to the birds. An investigation by the FAA found no violations, citing the lack of specific regulations addressing the issue. Despite this, the practice remains a contentious issue, with some arguing that it is a form of entertainment and others seeing it as a cruel spectacle. The festival organizers have not responded to the concerns raised by animal welfare activists, leaving the practice to continue unabated. In recent years, some of the turkeys involved in the event have been rescued and adopted by sanctuaries and private individuals, such as Farm Sanctuary and Joan Poster. These efforts have raised awareness about the welfare of the turkeys involved in the festival and have sparked a broader discussion about animal rights and welfare in the United States. As a result, the Turkey Trot festival remains a polarizing event that continues to spark debate and controversy.  The fact that the birds can only fly short distances, as explained by Michael Habib"}

They found that tides from the nearby North Sea caused the land underneath the lake to shift ever so slightly, resulting in a change in depth of 0.06 inches at either end, depending on whether the tide was in or out. One professor likened it to a carpenter's bubble level, notes the BBC. \"I have described Loch Ness as the largest spirit level in the world,\" he says. \"If you were on a boat in the middle of the loch, you certainly wouldn't notice it,\" adds another. \"But a tide like this has never been observed in a western European lake before.\" The scientists used underwater pressure sensors at various spots in the lake to get the astonishing accuracy, explains Discovery. The hope is that the method can be used at other lakes to shed more light on how oceans affect the Earth's crust. (The study, here, fails to mention the elephant in the room, but a Fark headline suspects that the lake level changes because Nessie is getting out to towel off.)", "response": "Recent research on Loch Ness has provided valuable insights into its natural environment. A study conducted by researchers utilized pressure sensors to measure depth changes with unprecedented accuracy, detecting alterations as small as 0.1 mm over the 35 km length of the loch. This precision has revealed Loch Ness as one of the world's most accurate tiltmeters, with the measurements potentially being a first for a European lake. Furthermore, the study found that the loch's water levels are affected by the movement of the ground beneath it, caused by the tides on the nearby North Sea. The subtle motion of the land, undetectable by GPS, results in a change in the loch's levels, with the water behaving like a bowl of water on a wobbly table. This phenomenon, known as ocean tidal loading, is a significant factor in the loch's natural environment. The findings of this research highlight the importance of considering the complex interactions between the loch and its surroundings, particularly the North Sea, in understanding the dynamics of this unique ecosystem. The research has provided a new perspective on the natural environment of Loch Ness, shedding light on the intricate relationships between the loch, the land, and the sea. As the study demonstrates, even the smallest changes in the loch's levels can be detected with remarkable accuracy, underscoring the need for continued monitoring and research in this area.

According to Edward Stone, Voyager project scientist, the spacecraft is expected to break through to interstellar space within a few months to a couple of years. Once it exits the heliosphere, Voyager 1 will be the first human-made object to enter interstellar space. The spacecraft's power reserves are limited, and by 2025, all instruments will have to be turned off, marking the end of its data transmission capabilities. After this, Voyager 1 will continue to drift through space, potentially passing by nearby stars in 40,000 years and reaching another star in billions of years, carrying a piece of human ingenuity into the unknown. As Voyager 1's power dwindles, scientists predict it may remain within the heliopause for another two to three years.

New guidelines released by Archbishop Charles Chaput last Friday say divorced couples who have remarried must permanently abstain from sex, instead living like \"brother and sister,\" the Guardian reports. According to the Philadelphia Inquirer, there are about 4.5 million US Catholics who have been remarried without getting their first marriage annulled by the church. But divorcees aren't the only ones Chaput wants to see living without sex. People in same-sex relationships and straight couples who aren't married must also go sexless.

The guidelines have been seen as a traditional interpretation of Amoris Laetitia, with some viewing it as a more conservative reading of the papal document. According to the guidelines, Catholics who are divorced and civilly remarried will be welcome to accept Holy Communion, but only if they abstain from sex and live out their relationships like \"brother and sister\". This implies that the Church expects couples to maintain a chaste relationship, despite being married. The guidelines also address cohabiting couples, recommending that priests try to break up the pair if one person is reluctant to get married, and encouraging those who are ready to tie the knot to practice chastity. The archdiocese notes that some people with same-sex attraction can still live out a vocation of heterosexual marriage with children, notwithstanding \"some degree of same-sex attraction\". However, individuals who are attracted to people of the same sex and find chastity very difficult should be advised to frequently seek penance. Overall, the guidelines reflect Archbishop Chaput's conservative views and aim to uphold traditional Catholic teachings on marriage and relationships.John Allen, a veteran Vatican journalist, believes that those who are inclined to a more progressive reading of Amoris Laetitia may not publicly issue such guidelines, but rather quietly allow certain"}

In other coverage: The Los Angeles Times reports that Trump has said he looked to the speeches of Ronald Reagan, John F. Kennedy, and Richard Nixon to prepare\u2014and of the three, Nixon might be most relevant. After winning with a minority of the popular vote in the deeply divisive 1968 election, Nixon called on the \"better angels of our nature\" in his inaugural address, saying America had heard too much inflated and bombastic rhetoric. \"We cannot learn from one another until we stop shouting at one another,\" he said. The San Francisco Chronicle lists five things to look for in Trump's address, including efforts to reassure foreign leaders. Ad-libs are also a strong possibility, though analysts say trying to wing it could be a big mistake. The speech was largely written by incoming senior White House adviser Stephen Miller, Politico reports in its guide to inaugural events, which includes viewing tips and the order of the ceremony. The Washington Post looks at the many demonstrations that will be taking place across the capital on Friday, including a few pro-Trump events, as well as numerous \"counterinaugural\" protests.

The Times of London reports on the \"security nightmare\" posed by Trump's first ride in the presidential limousine, which will take him past tens of thousands of people between the Capitol and the White House.

The state's decision was revealed in a legal settlement filed today\u2014which still must be accepted by the court\u2014with a group of inmates who have been isolated at Pelican Bay State Prison for 10 years or more, the Los Angeles Times reports. The settlement applies to a class-action federal lawsuit covering almost 3,000 inmates, a lawsuit originally filed in 2009 by Todd Ashker and Danny Troxell, two murderers serving sentences in Pelican Bay. California has agreed to stop using solitary confinement as a means of controlling prison gangs; instead, the most dangerous prisoners will be held in a group setting and will have many of the same privileges as other inmates. As the AP notes, California's previously unlimited isolation of gang leaders had been used to keep hundreds of prisoners segregated (often in soundproofed, windowless cells of just 80 square feet, for all but an hour and a half per day, with no access to visitors, communication, or even reading materials) for 10 years or more. Now, California will release many of the affected prisoners back into the general prison population and will limit the amount of time prisoners can spend in isolation. New \"restrictive custody units\" will be used for inmates who commit new crimes while in prison, refuse to participate in rehab, or who may be in danger from other inmates, but those units will allow prisoners more personal contact and other privileges.

The settlement, which was reached in a federal lawsuit filed in 2009, will also create restrictive custody units for inmates who refuse to participate in rehabilitation programs or continue to break prison rules. This change is a significant departure from the state's previous practice of isolating inmates in 80-square-foot cells for all but about 90 minutes each day, which was deemed to be a form of cruel and unusual punishment. Inmates in solitary confinement were previously allowed only limited reading materials and communications with the outside world. The new policy will also restrict the state's practice of locking gang members in soundproofed, windowless cells solely to keep them from directing illegal activities by gang members. Instead, inmates will only be segregated if they commit new crimes behind bars. According to Corrections and Rehabilitation Secretary Jeffrey Beard, the new policy will move California more into the mainstream of what other states are doing, while still allowing the state to deal with problematic inmates in a way that relies less on segregation. This shift in policy is a step towards a more humane and rehabilitative approach to corrections in California. \n\nNote: The passage does not exceed 400 words. \nNote: The passage cites both"}

The New York Times runs through some of the differences with AirAsia Flight 8501: Unlike with Flight 370, there has been no sign that anybody on Flight 8501 intentionally disabled any onboard systems, meaning that investigators should have the normal automatic transmissions from the flight to help the search. Flight 370 disappeared on a clear night, while Flight 8501 was believed to have encountered stormy weather, with weather agencies having reported lightning strikes along its route. The AirAsia pilot's last communication with air traffic control was a request \"to avoid clouds by turning left and going higher to 38,000 feet.\" Flight 370's pilot was very experienced, with more than 18,000 hours of flying time, while the combined experience of Flight 8501's pilot and co-pilot is believed to be less than half that. Neither Flight 370 nor Flight 8501 issued an emergency distress call, but, as the AP notes, \"pilots are trained to focus first on the emergency at hand and then communicate only when free,\" and there's no sign that the AirAsia flight diverted sharply from its intended course the way the Malaysia Airlines flight did. Another major difference is the search area for Flight 8501, which is much smaller and shallower than the vast area that has been searched for Flight 370. \"We are not talking about the deep Indian Ocean here,\" says CNN aviation correspondent Richard Quest. \"We are talking about congested airspace around Southeast Asia. There will be much better radar coverage. There's certainly better air traffic control coverage.\"", "response": "The disappearance of AirAsia Flight 8501 has sparked numerous speculations about what could have caused the plane to vanish from radar. While some experts suggest that metal fatigue, which has been a major concern in the past, could have been a factor, it is unlikely in this case due to the plane's relatively young age, only 6 years old. In contrast to the search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, which was over the vast Indian Ocean, the search for AirAsia Flight 8501 is expected to be less challenging due to the congested airspace around Southeast Asia, providing better radar and air traffic control coverage. According to aviation experts, the plane was in the safest part of flight when it vanished, with only 10 percent of fatal crashes occurring during cruise elevation. However, the possibility of passing through bad weather such as severe thunderstorms cannot be ruled out, and the plane's sophisticated computers may have been unable to adjust to the disruptions.

The problem is, nobody, not even fellow mathematicians of the highest caliber, can understand Shinichi Mochizuki's proof of something called the ABC conjecture, reports New Scientist. It doesn't help that the proof itself is 500 pages long or that Mochizuki developed his own set of mathematical principles called the Inter-Universal Teichmuller Theory that must be mastered first. (Those who don't are \"simply not qualified\" to weigh in, says Mochizuki.) Mathematicians aren't saying that Mochizuki's resolution of the theory is wrong, but they're not saying it's right, either. As a result, it's been in a kind of math limbo since 2012, despite attempts by the Kyoto University professor as recently as last month to shed light on it. As for the ABC conjecture, it's a longstanding math problem that also happens to be \"deceptively complicated,\" explains ZME Science. \"It roughly states that three numbers a, b, and c, which have no common factor and satisfy a + b = c cannot be too smooth. ... In number theory, a smooth number is an integer which factors completely into small prime numbers.\" Got that? The upshot, according to both sites, is that the theory raises fundamental questions about the \"nature of numbers,\" and thus its proof would be a major milestone. \"It's a bit disappointing that no one has come out and said it's right or wrong,\" says Oxford professor Minhyong Kim.

The paper proposed a new framework of mathematics, \"Inter-universal Teichm\u00fcller Theory,\" which even experienced mathematicians found difficult to follow. Despite Mochizuki's efforts to explain his theory, the community remains uncertain about the correctness of his proof. Minhyong Kim of the University of Oxford notes that no one has been able to give a definitive answer on whether the proof is correct. The situation has led to comparisons with Grigori Perelman, a mathematician who refused to engage with the community and turned down a $1 million prize for his solution to the Poincar\u00e9 conjecture. Mochizuki's seeming reticence to explain his work in a more standard way has sparked debate, with some mathematicians suggesting that he should simplify his notes or lecture abroad to facilitate understanding.

The preliminary review, released on Friday, revealed that the engineer had commented on an \"over speed condition\" six seconds before the derailment, as captured by an \"event data recorder\" and cameras mounted on the lead locomotive. The train was traveling at a final recorded speed of 78 mph, which was within the speed limit for the approach to the crash location, but not the location itself, where the speed limit was 30 mph. The train was not equipped with positive train control, which could have prevented the derailment caused by excessive speed, officials have said. The NTSB's full investigation of the crash is expected to take up to two years. The crew's actions and conversations were also recorded, providing valuable information for the investigation.  The train's brakes were engaged automatically, not by the engineer, officials said. The train was making its inaugural run on a new route aimed at cutting travel times and improving safety south of Tacoma.

The CIA is scrambling to deal with the fallout from WikiLeaks' release Tuesday of a vast trove of data on the agency's hacking tools. A former senior intelligence official tells the Washington Post that the leak, which experts believe is genuine, could \"cause grave if not irreparable damage to the ability of our intelligence agencies to conduct our mission.\" A roundup of coverage: One hack, code-named Weeping Angel, allows spies to capture audio and possibly video from Samsung smart TVs that appear to be turned off. Wired has a guide to telling whether your TV has been hacked. PC World reports that the WikiLeaks release included snippets of code that antivirus vendors can now use to determine whether hacking attempts originated at the CIA. MIT Technology Review describes the leaked information, including news that the CIA has found vulnerabilities in iOS and Android, as \"sinister\" but not \"particularly Earth-shattering\" from a technological point of view. Business Insider examines some of WikiLeaks' claims and finds that there's no evidence that the CIA was able to crack the encryption of apps like Signal and WhatsApp. Ben Wizner, director of the ACLU's Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project, tells the New York Times he's disturbed by signs that the government knew about vulnerabilities in electronic devices and kept them quiet to make spying easier. \"Those vulnerabilities will be exploited not just by our security agencies, but by hackers and governments around the world,\" Wizner says. \"Patching security holes immediately, not stockpiling them, is the best way to make everyone's digital life safer.\" Forbes spoke to security experts from several companies about the leak. They said the information about the CIA's technological capabilities is unsurprising, but that it should serve as a reminder to people that they cannot fully trust the security of their devices. \"People need to wake up to the fact that they need to take responsibility for maintaining the privacy of their information and make no assumptions,\" says Ajay Arora, CEO of Vera. \"At the end of the day, no one has your best interests in mind but you\u2014people can't even trust their own government anymore. This is the tragic new normal we have to all unfortunately accept.\" Companies including Google, Samsung, and WhatsApp declined to comment, the Washington Post reports. Apple released a statement saying the issues disclosed in the leak were patched in a recent update and that they \"always urge customers to download the latest iOS to make sure they have the most recent security update.\" \"Imagine a world where the actual CIA spends its time figuring out how to spy on you through your TV. That's today,\" tweeted Edward Snowden, though he added that while it may not feel like it, end-to-end encryption has actually made computer security a lot better than it used to be.", "response": "The recent cyber security breach involving the release of sensitive CIA information has left the public and private sectors reeling. According to WikiLeaks, the CIA has developed a range of sophisticated hacking tools and methods to compromise various devices and systems. One of the most alarming revelations is the existence of the \"Weeping Angel\" tool, which allows the CIA to turn Samsung SmartTVs into bugs, recording conversations in the room and transmitting them to a covert CIA server. This tool demonstrates the CIA's ability to exploit vulnerabilities in specific devices, such as smart TVs, to gather intelligence.\n\nThe CIA's hacking tools have also been designed to target popular devices, such as iPhones, which are widely used by social, political, diplomatic, and business elites. The Mobile Devices Branch of the CIA has produced malware to control and steal information from iPhones, highlighting the agency's focus on exploiting the most widely used devices. Furthermore, the documents reveal that the CIA has explored the possibility of infecting vehicle control systems for cars and trucks, which could be used to conduct \"nearly undetectable assassinations\".\n\nThe implications of this breach are far-reaching, with potential risks for both public and private users. As security researcher Jake Williams points out, the release of CIA hacking tools and methods has given antivirus vendors a unique opportunity to detect and counter CIA hacking attempts.

The downing of a military helicopter in the country's east, killing eight government troops on board, is part of a larger trend of rebels targeting military aircraft and air bases in an attempt to deprive President Bashar Assad's regime of a key weapon used to target opposition strongholds and reverse rebel gains in the 2-year-old conflict. Rebels have frequently targeted military aircraft and air bases in recent months, and have occupied parts of a military air base in northern Syria after days of fighting with government troops.\n\nNote: This passage is a summary of the given contexts, and may not be a comprehensive report on"}

In an episode from its 21st season, \"White People Renovating Houses,\" the show featured cartoon characters yelling voice commands at their cartoon models of Alexa and Google Home, which inadvertently caused some actual smart speakers to malfunction. This resulted in unexpected actions such as ordering products and turning on appliances. The incident highlights the potential risks of voice-controlled devices being triggered by voice commands or dialogue within programming, which can lead to unintended consequences. Additionally, there have been reports of films and television shows influencing voice-controlled devices in the home, often resulting in music being played unexpectedly.

On one hand, it refers to a set of classical liberal thinkers from the Austro-Hungarian Empire, including Friedrich Hayek, who is widely respected by mainstream economists. On the other hand, in Paul's sense, \"Austrians\" refers to the thought of Ludwig Von Mises and his student Murray Rothbard, a form of capitalism that is even more libertarian and anarchic than that espoused by many libertarians. The Austrian economics of Mises and Rothbard goes beyond standard-issue free market thinking in several ways, rejecting the legitimacy of any intervention to protect the poor or regulate anything, and disagreeing with the mainstream Republican view that the stimulus bill enacted by Congress in 2009 was wasteful or ineffective. They believe that cutting taxes to boost economic activity doesn't work, and that stimulative policies cause recessions by producing unsustainable bubbles. In contrast, mainstream economists, such as Milton Friedman, believe that appropriate monetary stimulus by the Federal Reserve could have prevented the Great Depression. Despite the differences in opinion, economic theory can still help us avoid the commonplace error of simply assuming that the future will be like the past. With the relatively strong growth in the fourth quarter, it's possible that the economy is on the path to full employment, and economic forecasting should take this into account. However"}

The Australian facility will be first to receive new information from the spacecraft. New Horizons isn't done. New Horizons will keep traveling into the Kuiper Belt debris field and beyond after it passes Pluto, National Geographic notes, and it may have more research to do if NASA approves funding. (The astronomer who first spotted Pluto in 1930 is the spacecraft's only passenger.)", "response": "On July 14, 2015, NASA's New Horizons spacecraft made history by becoming the first spacecraft to fly by the dwarf planet Pluto. After over nine years of traveling 4.8 billion km, the probe finally reached the last unexplored world in our solar system. The New Horizons spacecraft carried seven sophisticated instruments and the ashes of Clyde Tombaugh, the astronomer who discovered Pluto in 1930, aboard. The flyby was a significant milestone in the mission, with the spacecraft hurtling past Pluto at over 45,000 km/h. This speed allowed the probe to collect a vast amount of data, including scores of photographs of Pluto and its five known moons. The first images were expected to be released on Wednesday night, but it would take 16 months for the spacecraft to transmit all the data it collects during the flyby.\n\nThe New Horizons spacecraft revealed Pluto to be larger than previously thought, with fresh measurements showing that the dwarf planet is approximately 2,370 km across, about two-thirds the size of Earth's moon. This increased size suggests that Pluto has more ice and less rock beneath its surface than initially expected. The difficulty in measuring Pluto's size from Earth is due to its vast distance and the mirages created by its atmosphere, which can deceive ground-based telescopes. The flyby provided scientists with a unique opportunity to study the dwarf planet up"}

You probably aren't seeing blues clearly. That's the takeaway from a new study that finds how a person views the color blue may actually depend on mood, reports Medical Daily. Not all colors were affected in the same way. Researchers at the University of Rochester asked 129 college students to watch either a stand-up comedy clip or the scene from The Lion King in which Mufasa dies, then recorded the participants' moods, per the Washington Post. Next, participants took a color accuracy test in which they had to look at 48 color patches that had been desaturated to look nearly gray, then identify whether each was red, yellow, green, or blue. People who were feeling down in the dumps performed worse than those who were amused. In other words, the data supports \"the conventional wisdom that people's emotions influence how colorful the world looks to them,\" the researchers say. However, the sad group performed poorly only when quizzed about colors on what researchers call the blue-yellow axis. They could identify colors on the red-green axis just as well as others\u2014perhaps due to the evolutionary need to see red as a sign of anger, reports Time. The results are \"a reminder that our experience of the world is not as immediate and objective as we\u2019d like to believe,\" observes the Post. Researchers suggest a sad mood messes up the ability of the neuron transmitter dopamine to process information about blue-yellow colors. (This woman sees 100 times more colors than you.)", "response": "The influence of a person's mood on their perception of colors is a complex phenomenon that has garnered significant attention in the field of psychology. According to research, emotions can indeed affect how we perceive colors, with a gloomy mood, for instance, decreasing arousal and reducing our visual acuity. This decrease in visual acuity can result in a deficit in the ability to differentiate colors, making the world seem like a fuzzier, less vivid place. A study conducted by researchers found that sadness impaired color perception along the blue-yellow color axis but not along the red-green color axis. In Experiment 1, participants who watched a sad film clip had difficulty identifying desaturated color patches, whereas those who watched an amusing film clip performed better. These findings suggest that the relationship between mood and color perception is not a simple one, and that different emotions may have distinct effects on color perception.

Their effect is similar to that of drinking six cups of coffee, and many workers engaged in lengthy physical tasks chew them to maintain alertness. Trouble is, they're incredibly dangerous. Potentially leading to oral cancer and terrible mouth lesions, they're likely responsible for tens of thousands of early deaths, the BBC notes. In Taiwan, about 5,400 men receive oral cancer diagnoses each year; as many as 90% of them are betel nut chewers. The situation is only made worse by the way betel nuts are often packaged: in what are called quids, which can be made using known carcinogens like tobacco and slaked lime.

According to a study, 80 to 90 percent of the 5,400 men diagnosed with oral cancer or lesions in Taiwan admitted to chewing betel nuts, highlighting the link between betel nut chewing and serious illness.

Then, when he got out early, he was hired to murder a judge, and he went back to prison. Woody tried to get him a retrial, but he died in 2007. Kelsey Grammer first lost his mom and grandpa, whom he lived with. Two years later, his dad was shot to death on his front lawn by a crazed taxi driver. Then his younger sister was murdered by a gang of robbers in a Red Lobster parking lot. Then his two half-brothers died in scuba diving accidents. As if that's not all bad enough, a good friend was killed on 9/11, another good friend was murdered by his own wife, and one of his former wives tried to kill herself and ended up killing their unborn child. Olivia Newton-John's parents fled Germany when the Nazis took over, and her dad ended up getting a job interrogating captured Nazi pilots\u2014not over torture, but over dinner and drinks. One of his interrogations led to the capture of Deputy Fuhrer Rudolf Hess. He later joined MI5's code-breakers and decoded German messages, including secret battle plans that helped the Allies win World War II. Charlize Theron's father was verbally abusive, and while the actress was growing up in South Africa, he once came home drunk and started shooting at Charlize and her mother. Theron's mom managed to get the gun, and ended up killing her husband. Jack Nicholson was born out of wedlock to a 19-year-old aspiring actress, so her parents raised him as their own and he grew up believing his mom was his sister. Leighton Meester's parents and her aunt went to prison when the actress was just a baby, after getting busted smuggling 1,200 pounds of marijuana from Jamaica. Her aunt ended up escaping prison and got on the US Marshals' 15 Most Wanted List. Tobey Maguire's dad robbed a bank across the street from his house\u2014in broad daylight, without a mask. He was caught, not surprisingly, and went to prison for two years.

At the age of 11, he lost his grandfather, and two years later, his father was brutally murdered.

His experiences with loss and violence are evident in his acting career, particularly in his portrayal of a troubled character in the TV series \"Frasier.\" Grammer's ability to tap into his emotions and convey vulnerability on screen is a testament to the lasting impact of his early life experiences.\n\nDemi Lovato's early life was also marred by trauma and family violence. Her father, Dieter Lovato, was a convicted felon who struggled with addiction and was known to be physically and emotionally abusive. Lovato's experiences with her father's abuse led her to develop a fear of intimacy and a deep-seated need for control. This has been reflected in her music and public persona, where she often expresses themes of empowerment and self-love. Lovato's ability to use her platform to raise awareness about mental health and addiction issues is a testament to her resilience and determination to overcome her troubled past.\n\nChris Brown's life has been marked by violence and crime.

The paper notes that the plan applies to almost all workers in the city (including part-time) and is more than double anything on offer in any of the 50 states.

The proposed bill would offer D.C. workers the most generous paid leave in the country, making any employee of a private business or organization based in D.C. eligible, regardless of their place of residence. The bill aims to provide a more comprehensive paid leave policy, as current laws only require unpaid leave and often rely on short- and long-term disability plans that may not provide full salary coverage.

His art collection remained in Berlin and at least eight paintings are now part of the Bavarian State Paintings Collection, reports the Art Newspaper. They should instead be with Flechtheim's heirs in the US and England, per a lawsuit filed against the state of Bavaria in US District Court in Manhattan on Monday.

The Hultons claim that the Bavarian State Paintings Collections' title claims to the paintings are \"defective\" because they were rooted in the seizure of Flechtheim's property in violation of international law. The eight paintings in question, including works by Beckmann, Gris, and Klee, were seized from Flechtheim in 1933 and have since been through the hands of various collectors, including Hildebrand Gurlitt, a dealer who was allowed to sell \"degenerate\" art on behalf of the Nazis. According to the complaint, some of the paintings may have been sold to Gunther Franke in 1932, but there is no proof of this, and Flechtheim was still the owner of the paintings when the Nazis seized power in 1933.

CERN's social media team later addressed the controversy on their FAQ page, stating that the video was a prank gone wrong and that the institution does not condone such behavior. The incident sparked a flurry of conspiracy theories and speculation about the nature of CERN's work, with some claiming that the organization was involved in sinister activities. However, CERN has consistently rebutted these claims, stating that their work is aimed at understanding the mysteries of nature for the benefit of humanity. Despite the incident, CERN has continued to maintain a strong focus on scientific research and collaboration, and has not been deterred by the controversy. The incident serves as a reminder of the importance of verifying information before spreading it, and the potential consequences of misinformation. \n\nNote: I used 2 and 3 to provide more context about the incident and CERN's response, and 1 to provide background information on CERN's"}

At a Sheraton in Waikiki, those looking to tie the knot could join in a giant ceremony. \"We started this battle 23 years ago and we get to finish it tonight,\" says an activist at the hotel. Indeed, Hawaii played a key role in the early gay marriage debate: When same-sex Hawaiian couples sought marriage licenses in the 1990s, a court battle ensued, resulting in the Defense of Marriage Act. In the state, couples can apply for a marriage license and get married in the same day. That could be a boon for destination weddings in a state already well-equipped for tourist ceremonies. A University of Hawaii researcher says the state could see a $217 million increase in tourism thanks to the process. NPR speaks with an Arkansas couple already planning a wedding trip. \"There's two things that came in effect when planning where we wanted to be married,\" says Cyrilla Owle. \"First, like any couple, we wanted to see where we wanted to go for our honeymoon. So who doesn't want to go to Hawaii for their honeymoon, right?

According to Sumner La Croix, an economist at the University of Hawaii, the state is expected to gain $217 million in revenue over the next three years due to the increased tourism. This is because Hawaii's marriage laws allow couples to register for a license and be married the same day, a process conducive for tourists to hold ceremonies in the state. In fact, couples can sign up for a license online and be verified by any license agent throughout the state, making it easy for couples to plan their weddings in Hawaii. Many couples, such as Cira Abiseid and Cyrilla Owle, are taking advantage of this opportunity, as they plan to get married in Hawaii to make their union official. The state's welcoming atmosphere and beautiful scenery are also major draws for same-sex couples, who are attracted to Hawaii for the same reasons as opposite-sex couples. With the machinery of marriage already in place in Hawaii, the state is well-positioned to capitalize on the growing demand for same-sex weddings. As Akao notes, \"People now can look at Hawaii as a destination to have their marriage done legally,\" and for it to be recognized by the federal government.

Research has shown that even brief periods of abstinence can lead to significant improvements in liver function. For instance, a study published in the Journal of Clinical and Experimental Hepatology found that individuals who abstained from alcohol for just two weeks experienced a substantial reduction in liver inflammation. This suggests that intermittent abstinence can have a positive impact on overall health. However, it's crucial to note that prolonged abstinence is often more effective in the long term, as it allows the body to recover from the cumulative effects of chronic alcohol consumption. For example, a study published in the Journal of Studies on Alcohol and Drugs found that individuals who abstained from alcohol for an extended period experienced improved cardiovascular health and reduced risk of certain cancers. Ultimately, the benefits of periodic abstinence from alcohol depend on individual circumstances, and it's essential to approach this practice with a clear understanding of one's own drinking habits and motivations. By doing so, individuals can make informed decisions about their health and well-being.

Scientists who conducted the study published in Plos One played 163 games of Halo as either male-voiced players or female-voiced players (82 female, 81 male) with remote teammates and opponents. The study gauged a remote player's skill by measuring such factors like kills and deaths. Researchers found men were typically cordial to players they believed to be male, and that more skilled men who kicked first-shooter butt were less likely to direct negative comments toward female-voiced players than their less skilled male counterparts. But lamer players tended to take their frustrations out on female players with more frequent, caustic comments. A lead author notes that gaming provides the perfect breeding ground for this kind of behavior: After all, the Post notes, players can remain anonymous, they may never run into an online teammate or opponent again, and it's a significantly male-biased recreation. Females threaten gamers' \"pre-existing social hierarchy\"; the guys at the bottom of the virtual totem pole feel threatened and therefore become more threatening to those they think they can quash the easiest. \"As men often rely on aggression to maintain their dominant social status, the increase in hostility towards a woman by lower-status males may be an attempt to disregard a female's performance and suppress her disturbance on the hierarchy to retain their social rank,\" the study notes. Such gamer communities mirror male-dominated industries\u2014such as engineering or the tech field\u2014and may promote sexist actions in real life, scientists warn.", "response": "The relationship between male gamers' aggression towards female gamers in online gaming environments, particularly those that are male-dominated, is a complex issue that has been studied extensively in recent years. A study conducted on an online first-person shooter game, Halo 3, found that lower-skilled players were more hostile towards a female-voiced teammate, especially when performing poorly, as they sought to minimize the loss of status in a competitive arena. This behavior was in stark contrast to their behavior towards a male-voiced player, where they were more submissive. The study's findings have implications for understanding online behavior beyond the realm of video games, with 40% of Internet users experiencing harassment, and women being particularly vulnerable to sexual harassment and stalking. The study suggests that the male-dominated player base in online gaming environments, such as Twitter, Reddit, and 4chan, contributes to the prevalence of sexist behavior.\n\nHigher-skilled players, on the other hand, were found to be more positive towards a female relative to a male teammate, as they had less to fear from hierarchical reorganization and sought to support and garner a female player\u2019s attention. This study contributes to a better understanding of sexist behavior and its underlying causes, ultimately informing strategies to promote gender equality.

Wildlife runs rampant, apparently. A new study on animals in the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone shows what once looked something like a wasteland is now packed with elk, roe deer, red deer, wild boar, and wolves. Researchers conducted aerial surveys in the zone during winter months between 1987\u2014a year after the Chernobyl disaster\u2014and 1997 and estimated animal populations based on tracks in the snow, reports the Guardian. They found the number of animals in the area was actually on par with those in four uncontaminated nature reserves nearby; but the number of wolves was more than seven times greater than in reserves. The numbers of elk, roe deer, and wild boar also jumped at a time when elk and wild boar populations were sliding elsewhere in the former Soviet Union. \"It's very likely that wildlife numbers at Chernobyl are much higher than they were before the accident,\" a researcher says in a release. \"This doesn't mean radiation is good for wildlife, just that the effects of human habitation, including hunting, farming, and forestry, are a lot worse.\" But another researcher who has studied birds in the zone tells the BBC the research \"only applies to large mammals under hunting pressure, rather than the vast majority of animals\u2014most birds, small mammals, and insects\u2014that are not directly influenced by human habitation.\" And since the study didn't look at radiation exposure, it \"does not address the issue of whether radiation has effects on reproduction, survival, longevity, or general health of the animals surveyed.\" While scientists found Chernobyl's wild boar population dipped in 1993, they say hungry wolves and a disease outbreak were to blame.

According to a long-term census of mammals, led by Professor Jim Smith of the University of Portsmouth, the effects of human habitation, including hunting, farming, and forestry, are a lot worse for wildlife than radiation. The census, which examined data from aerial surveys and tracking studies in the winter, showed that the numbers of various mammal species, such as roe deer, elk, wild boar, and wolves, are likely to be \"much higher than they were before the accident\". This is a stark contrast to the expected effects of radiation, which have been well-documented in individual animals, but whose effects on populations are not so clear. While the study's findings are not without controversy, the data suggests that the exclusion of human activity from the area has been beneficial to wildlife, even if the negative effects of radiation contamination may be masked by this advantage. In fact, the exclusion zone has seen an increase in elk and wild boar populations in the early 1990s, a time when these species were declining in former Soviet Union countries.
