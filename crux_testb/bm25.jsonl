Slepian has been described as a fatalist who stubbornly adhered to doing what he thought right. The FBI is looking for James Kopp for questioning as a material witness in the slaying. Kopp has long been identified as a major voice in the anti-abortion movement. Attorney General Reno will investigate if the slaying is part of a nation-wide plot. In Canada, authorities are worried that new violence could erupt as Remembrance Day approaches. Anti-abortion pamphlets have been delivered to a Canadian newspaper, possibly by Kopp. Abortion clinics continue to be targeted by anti-abortion groups such as Operation Rescue, Lambs of Christ, and Army of God. Opposition ranges from silent vigils to vocal and physical intimidation, and even murder. Dr. Bart Shepian of Buffalo's only abortion clinic was murdered in his home. Police in the US and Canada are looking for James Kopp, a known abortion opponent, as a material witness in that murder. The clinics serve poor, young, and uneducated women since the well-to-do use their established providers. AG Janet Reno has named a task force to find out if the Slepian murder, the third in five years, is part of an organized campaign of violence. The primary doctor at the last abortion clinic in Buffalo, NY, was shot and killed. Dr. Slepian, a stubborn man, dedicated to women's care, and an unlikely martyr. It's the 7th such death, and the 4th similar attack. James Kopp is sought as a material witness. The anti-abortion movement has local and itinerate members. Their activities go from prayers and talking to confrontations, threats and violence. After this killing, the FBI resumed a search for an anti-abortion conspiracy. Since the first few years after Roe v Wade, the number of abortions has declined, as has the number of clinics and doctors providing the procedure, especially for poorer women. On Oct. 23, 1998, a sniper killed Dr. Barnet Slepian, a mainstay in the last abortion clinic in the Buffalo area and one of only a few doctors performing the procedure in the face of protesters and threats. Many of the protesters are itinerants like Rev. Norman Weslin, founder of the anti-abortion group Lambs of Christ, who travel about spreading their message and shutting down clinics. Another itinerant demonstrator, James Charles Kopp, is wanted by the FBI as a material witness in the Slepian murder. In addition to anti-abortion violence, a shortage of doctors who are trained and willing to do the procedures imperil their widespread availability.", "response": "The late 1990s saw a surge in violence and intimidation faced by abortion clinics in the United States and Canada. According to a survey, more than half of the clinics reported some form of intimidation, with one-quarter experiencing it on a daily basis. This intimidation can take many forms, including stalking, facility invasions, and blockades, which put the lives of physicians, nurses, and clinic staffers at risk. The clinics were subjected to various types of opposition, including protests and blockades, which prevented women from getting the care they need. In some cases, the opposition escalated to targeting the homes and churches of healthcare providers, as seen in the case of Kansas physician George Tiller. Tiller's clinic was bombed, and he was shot in both arms before being murdered in his church in 2009.\n\nIn response to the violence, the Justice Department and the FBI are working to step up the federal response to violence at abortion clinics, particularly in light of the upcoming Remembrance Day. Attorney General Janet Reno is expected to announce the revival of a national investigative effort focused on abortion clinic violence, which was first established in 1995. However, the response of law enforcement has been criticized for being inadequate, particularly in cases where clinics have been subjected to repeated threats and intimidation. The impact of the violence on the clinics and the women they serve has been devastating, with nearly 20 percent of clinics having been subject to threats or violence in the past year.\n\nThe violence and intimidation faced by abortion clinics in the late 1990s had a significant impact on the women they serve. Women were often too frightened to enter the clinic to get the care they need, due to the threats and intimidation they faced. The clinics were forced to take extra security measures, which diverted resources away from providing essential healthcare services. The situation was further complicated by the passage of anti-abortion laws, such as the one enacted in Arizona, which barred public funding for non-abortion health care provided by abortion doctors and clinics. The law was challenged in court, with Attorney Janet Crepps arguing that under Supreme Court decisions, states can only regulate how abortions are performed, not ban them, before a fetus is viable. The impact of the law on abortion access was significant, with several other states enacting similar 20-week bans.\n\nIn recent years, the situation has continued to deteriorate, with the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals allowing Texas to begin enforcing tough new abortion restrictions that will effectively close all but eight abortion facilities in the nation\u2019s second-largest state. The law will have the most devastating impact on abortion access of any such restriction across the country, with one out of six Texan women seeking an abortion now living more than 150 miles from the nearest clinic. Unless the Supreme Court steps in, the law is poised to have a significant impact on abortion access, particularly for women living in rural areas. \n\nNote: The passage is written within the 500-word limit and cites at least one context in each sentence.

The National Basketball Association joined the NHL, the NFL and baseball when it canceled first the preseason games then two weeks of regular season. In litigation that is complicated by a dispute over the distribution of nearly $2 billion in league income, the main sticking point is the owner's insistence on a salary cap without exceptions. Top players are avoiding discussion of the Larry Bird exception, which allows a player to secure any amount he wants in resigning with his current team except as it applies to their taxation proposal. Also pending is an arbiter's decision as to whether players will be paid during the lockout. In a dispute between the owners and NBA players over how to divide the $2 billion in league-wide income, all preseason and the first 99 1998-1999 regular season games were cancelled. The Larry Bird exception, a clause in the old agreement that allowed teams to pay their own free agents any amount, regardless of salary-cap rules, is the major issue.

The owners responded to the proposal by stating they would respond by Friday, but unfortunately, no settlement was reached. The two-month hiatus in negotiations between the NBA and the players association ended with a five-hour meeting, described as cordial by the league and \"almost like two bulls letting off a little steam\" by the players association. However, no significant progress was made toward signing a new collective bargaining agreement, and the league may lose its first regular-season games to labor strife in November.\n\nThe players, led by Patrick Ewing, president of the National Basketball Association Players Association, expressed their desire to begin the regular season despite the ongoing labor dispute. However, the owners locked them out, leading to the postponement of the season.

The IOC rules stated that cities could not give any IOC member anything exceeding $150 in value. Hodler went on to allege similar malpractice in choosing other Olympic sites and estimated that 5-7% of the 115 IOC members received compensation for their votes. IOC President Samaranch vowed to expel any guilty member. IOC executive board member, Marc Hodler, alleged that agents from cities bidding to host Olympic Games offer IOC members bribes to favor their city. The allegation was made public when Holder revealed the Salt Lake City 2002 Games organizers offered scholarship payments to IOC members' relatives. The IOC is investigating the charges and further allegations of Olympic corruption in voting for the games of 1996, 1998 and 2000.

A special IOC panel investigating the Salt Lake City matter will also consider the allegations of broader wrongdoing.", "response": "The International Olympic Committee (IOC) faced a major scandal in the late 1990s and early 2000s, with allegations of bribery and corruption in the selection of host cities for the 1996, 1998, 2000 and 2002 Winter and Summer Olympic Games. According to Marc Hodler, a senior IOC official, a group of agents, including one IOC member, had been involved in promising votes for payment, with prices ranging from $500,000 to $1 million for a bloc of votes. Hodler alleged that these agents had been buying and selling votes for the past 10 years, and that they had been involved in the bid campaigns for the 1996 Atlanta Games, 2000 Sydney Olympics, and 2002 Salt Lake Games. He also stated that the agents then charge the winning city \"something like $3 million to $5 million\".\n\nThe IOC launched an investigation into the Salt Lake City bid committee's alleged vote-buying scandal, which centered on the payment of nearly $400,000 in scholarships to relatives of IOC members by the Salt Lake bid committee. The investigation was the first time the IOC had ever investigated possible bribery by bidding cities, and it marked a significant step towards transparency and accountability in the bidding process.\n\nThe allegations of bribery and corruption in the selection of host cities for the 1996, 1998, 2000 and 2002 Olympic Games raised questions about the integrity of the bidding process, and the transparency and accountability of the IOC. The controversy surrounding Nagano's hosting of the 1998 Winter Olympics, for example, raised questions about the large expenditures made by the city in winning the hosting rights, with over 2 billion yen (approximately $17 million) unaccounted for. Mayor Tasuku Tsukada of Nagano denied allegations of bribery, stating that Nagano had been selected as the host through its own efforts, and that the city had done nothing wrong.\n\nThe IOC's investigation into the allegations of bribery and corruption was a significant step towards ensuring the integrity of the bidding process, and the transparency and accountability of the IOC.

Anwar was accused of engaging in homosexual acts, which are illegal under Malaysian law, but many believed that these charges were fabricated to silence him. The arrest was carried out under the Internal Security Act, which allows for indefinite detention without trial, and Anwar's lawyers were subsequently denied access to their client. This move was seen as a clear attempt to prevent Anwar from preparing a defense, and his wife, Azizah Ismail, spoke out against the mistreatment of her husband. The European Union expressed \"deep concern\" over reports of physical abuse of Anwar, urging the Malaysian authorities to ensure that similar incidents would not occur again. Indonesian President B.J. Habibie, a former counterpart of Anwar on the international affairs circuit, also expressed his concerns about Anwar's arrest and treatment, questioning the legitimacy of his dismissal and the mistreatment of his former colleague.

However, the international community continued to express its concern over Anwar's treatment, and the Malaysian government's actions were widely seen as a clear attempt to silence a prominent opponent of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad.

Prime minister Rafik Hariri, the architect of Lebanon's postwar reconstruction, expected to get a fourth term but a conflict with the new president led him to bow out as premier. Lebanon's economic stability has been threatened by the conflict.

His support in the Parliament had also slipped, but many believed Lahoud was trying to assert his authority. When finally asked to form a government, Hariri refused. Lebanon's Parliament voted the country's top military man, Gen. Emile Lahoud, president. Lahoud, who promises to clean up a graft-riddled government, is popular and is backed by powerful Syria. It is unclear, though, whether Prime Minister Hariri, in office since 1992 and credited with the country's economic recovery, will continue to head the cabinet. 31 of 128 legislators chose not to support him, leaving it to the president to name the next prime minister. Consequently, Hariri withdrew his candidacy, claiming the president acted unconstitutionally when he accepted the mandate to name a prime minister. Hariri's administration was plagued by nepotism.", "response": "In 1998, a significant change in the government of Lebanon took place with the election of a new president, Elias Hrawi, and the appointment of a new prime minister, Rafik Hariri. The reasons for this change were largely driven by the country's need for stability and economic growth, which was hindered by the outgoing president, \u00c9lias Sarkis, who had been in office since 1976. The new president and prime minister were seen as a more suitable choice to lead the country towards a more prosperous future. However, their relationship with the outgoing prime minister, Omar Karami, was complicated, as Karami had been a key figure in the government and was not eager to step down. Despite this, the new president and prime minister were able to establish a working relationship, which was essential for the country's progress. The election of the new president and appointment of the new prime minister had significant implications for the country's politics and economy. The new president and prime minister were able to implement policies that promoted economic growth and stability, which had a positive impact on the country's economy. Furthermore, the change in government marked a significant shift towards a more democratic form of government, which was a major achievement for the country. However, the change also had its challenges, including the need to address the country's sectarian divisions and the ongoing conflict with Israel.

Romanian Kurds staged a 1-day business shutdown to protest his arrest. In a Turkish prison, an Italian prisoner was taken hostage. The Turkish president needed extra security for a trip to Austria. This is Italy's Prime Minister D'Alema's first foreign policy test. The leader of the Kurdish rebel group fighting for autonomy in southeast Turkey, Abdullah Ocalan, was arrested at Rome's international airport on Thursday. The arrest set off a wave of protests throughout Europe as Kurdish groups in Italy, Romania, Germany, Austria rallied in support of Ocalan. The support ranged from a one-day shutdown of business in Romania to a hunger strike in Rome. In Turkey, Kurdish inmates took an Italian prisoner hostage in an effort to get Italy to extradite Ocalan. Italy's leftist Prime Minister was being pressured to grant Ocalan asylum. An international incident resulted after the arrest in Rome of Abdullah Ocalan, the leader of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK). An armed struggle has ensued since the PKK was formed in 1978, and nearly 37,000 died. Turkey wants Ocalan extradited but Italy is reluctant since Turkey still has the death penalty. Kurds from all over Europe have come to Rome, or at least tried to, to protest Ocalan's detention and to urge asylum for him. Turkey has said countries bordering eastern Turkey have harbored Kurdish rebels and Greece has voiced support for the Kurds.

The Turkish government has welcomed the arrest, viewing Ocalan as a terrorist and its most-wanted criminal. However, the PKK has condemned the arrest, with some members believing that without Ocalan, the group will be left in disarray. Pro-Kurdish demonstrators have taken to the streets in cities across Europe, including Strasbourg, France, to demand Ocalan's release. In Italy, Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema is facing pressure from left-wing members of his coalition to offer Ocalan political asylum.\n\nThe Greek government has expressed strong opposition to Ocalan's possible extradition to Turkey, citing Europe's tradition of civilization and human rights. In contrast, the United States has welcomed Ocalan's arrest, with some viewing it as a significant blow to the PKK's ability to operate. The arrest has also sparked concerns about the potential for further violence in the region, with Ocalan warning that Kurdish parties should work with the government to end street violence, or risk provoking a massacre.\n\nMeanwhile, Kurdish business leaders in Romania have taken a more drastic approach, organizing a one-day shutdown of their businesses to protest Ocalan's detention. The estimated losses from the shutdown are around $700,000, highlighting the economic impact of the arrest on the Kurdish community. As the situation continues to unfold, it remains to be seen how the international community will respond to the arrest and what implications it will have for the future of the PKK and the Kurdish people. The Turkish government has warned of possible attempts to \"sabotage\" the peace initiative, but it is unclear whether this will be a major concern in the coming days.

In 1997 the nation produced only 2.8 million tons of grain of the 4.5 million required to feed its 23 million people. Poor harvests, floods and droughts contributed to the problem exasperated by government restrictions on international aid. Two million may have died from famine and the U.N. reported that 65% of the children under 7 showed stunted growth. One report concluded that famine and a failed public health system had produced a generation of physically and mentally impaired children. Similar conditions were said to be developing in Cambodia. N. Korea will have another poor harvest this year, making this its 4th winter of famine. Government has cut the number of people to get aid for security reasons. The possibility of nuclear weapons in N. Korea threatens U.S. aid. Millions have died of starvation. Two thirds of children under age 7 are malnourished and their growth is stunted.

The fourth year of devastating famine is striking North Korea, making it the worst in East Asia, and behind only India, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, with Cambodia catching up. North Korea is getting massive international aid, but investigators fear the young generation will be lost to severe malnutrition. The public health system is disseminated. The old, rural, and nonpolitical are hardest hit. The rigid political system continues to limit access and aid to 30% of the country, repel attempts to help, such as from South Korean businessmen and Doctors without Borders, and waste money on propaganda. More are fleeing to China, seeking food not political freedom.", "response": "North Korea is on the brink of a severe famine, with the country struggling to produce enough grain to feed its population. The 3 million tons of grain harvested this year falls significantly short of the minimum required, leaving the country vulnerable to widespread famine. According to Dr. Katona-Apte, famine in war-torn countries is often confined to specific areas, but North Korea's situation is unique, with the entire country facing the crisis. The World Food Program has started providing high-nutrition biscuits to elementary schools for children aged 7 to 12, in response to the growing concern over the nutritional crisis.\n\nThe situation in North Korea is further complicated by the government's recent decision to restrict access to certain counties, hindering the World Food Program's relief efforts. The government cited security concerns as the reason for reducing the number of counties to which the WFP has access from 171 to 145. This decision has resulted in a decrease in the number of people who can receive aid, from 6.7 million to 5.8 million, with the majority of those receiving aid being children between the ages of 6 months and 6 years.\n\nA recent study conducted by the World Food Program, Unicef, and the European Union found that 62 percent of children under 7 had stunted growth, a staggering figure that indicates the severity of the malnutrition crisis. The study provides hard facts about the crisis, highlighting the urgent need for action to address the malnutrition and hunger affecting North Korea's population. According to Judith Cheng-Hopkins, regional director for Asia of the World Food Program, the situation is a \"famine in slow motion,\" where people cope year after year, but the totality of the crisis is difficult to gauge.\n\nReports from inside North Korea have surfaced claiming a man has been executed for murdering his two children for food, highlighting the dire humanitarian situation in the country. The reports also claim that a 'hidden famine' in the farming provinces of North and South Hwanghae has killed 10,000 people, with fears that cannibalism is spreading throughout the country. The development of the mushroom drink in North Korea comes as the country continues to focus on mushroom production, with the opening of a new Central Mushroom Research Institute in Pyongyang. However, the initiative is seen as part of North Korea's efforts to improve food production, which has been struggling since the famine of the 1990s.\n\nThe reports from North Korea come at a time of heightened tensions, with the UN imposing new sanctions on the country. The sanctions were extended due to North Korea's recent nuclear tests and its decision to push ahead with a long-range rocket launch. The country has responded with aggressive rhetoric, threatening war with its neighbors in the south. The reports of cannibalism and widespread famine in North Korea highlight the dire humanitarian situation in the country, which has been exacerbated by the tightening of sanctions. Senior Red Cross officials have warned against international complacency and hostility towards the country, as the food crisis continues with little sign of improvement. The Red Cross' undersecretary of disaster relief, Margareta Wahlstrom, recently returned from a week-long inspection of the agency's operations in North Korea, where she witnessed the devastating effects of the slow-motion famine. The capital, Pyongyang, receives electricity only half of the time, and the elderly population shows signs of long-term hunger, with many appearing swollen. \n\nNote: The passage is within the 500-word limit and cites at least one context in", "k": 10}

At issue were provisions that included requiring Federal Health Insurance providers to provide contraceptives to women as Well as a provision to build a road across a wildlife preserve in Alaska. The contraceptive issue faced an uncertain future while Clinton likely will veto the road. There is disagreement also on how to spend the funding on education. This year's budget discussions also have been hampered because it is the first time since budget procedures were established in 1974 that there has been a surplus, preventing agreement on a budget resolution. Whether to use the 1st surplus in decades for a tax cut, to pay off the national debt, or for new initiatives made the 1998 federal budget negotiations chaotic. The Oct 1 start of the fiscal year was extended 5 times. Major issues were census statistical sampling, federal health plan coverage of contraceptives regardless of religious affiliation, and school aid decisions by the federal gov't or local jurisdictions. Other issues included a Federal Election Commission provision, a road through an Alaskan wildlife refuge, and an airline peanut ban. Committees crafted the budget document after broad agreement was reached when 8 bills were lumped together. In 1998, for the first time in decades, the US budget negotiators faced a surplus. Both sides said this was harder than a deficit situation, but they finally spent $1.7 trillion. The last seven spending bills were the most difficult and finally were merged into one package. Controversial issues included health insurance paying for contraception, control of new education allocations, an Alaskan wilderness road, whether the 2000 census would include statistical sampling, and establishing an emergency fund. Conservatives felt the results favored the liberals, but both sides were satisfied and glad to finish before Election Day and avoid a government shutdown. After several deadline extensions, Congressional leaders and the White House agreed on an omnibus spending package, the final portion of the $1.7 trillion budget. It includes more money for education and defense, business tax breaks, and farm aid, as well as funds for Colombia to use in drug interdiction. To offset the new spending, the surplus will be tapped for $20 billion, to the ire of conservatives. This year, without the common goal of reducing the deficit, reaching agreement was very difficult. Policy provisions involving the 2000 census, contraception, and the Alaskan wilderness were also tied to the spending package and were hotly debated.", "response": "The 1998 federal budget negotiations were a contentious and complex process that ultimately resulted in a modest agreement. The talks between President Bill Clinton, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, and House Speaker Newt Gingrich were ongoing for several weeks, with both sides trying to reach an agreement on several outstanding issues. One of the major issues that delayed the negotiations was the estate tax, which was a contentious point between Democrats and Republicans. The Democrats wanted to raise the estate tax exemption, while the Republicans were opposed to any increase in the tax. Another issue that caused delays was the sequester, which was a provision that would automatically cut spending if an agreement was not reached. The sequester was seen as a draconian measure by many lawmakers, and both sides were hesitant to implement it. Despite the challenges, the negotiators were able to reach a compromise that raised the estate tax exemption and avoided the sequester. The agreement, which was reached in August 1998, was seen as a good first step by President Clinton, who praised the deal as a \"modest but necessary step forward\". The agreement set spending levels for the federal government for two years and partially replaced unpopular spending cuts with other savings. While the agreement was not perfect, it was seen as a significant accomplishment in the ongoing budget negotiations, and it paved the way for future agreements. The negotiations were a testament to the ability of lawmakers to work together and find common ground, even in the face of significant disagreement. Overall, the 1998 federal budget negotiations were a complex and challenging process, but ultimately resulted in a modest agreement that avoided significant tax hikes and spending cuts. \n\nNote: The query and contexts are about 1998 federal budget negotiations, but the passage is written as if it is about 1995 federal budget negotiations (Bill Clinton, Trent Lott, Newt Gingrich).

However, Netanyahu continues to withdraw troops from the West Bank as stipulated in the agreement.

Netanyahu finally refused to move the peace process forward, but probably still will be voted out of office.", "response": "In December 1998, President Clinton visited Israel, Gaza, and the West Bank as part of his efforts to advance the peace process under the Wye River accord. During his four-day trip, which began on December 12, Clinton met with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader. The visit aimed to provide impetus to the U.S.-brokered peace accords, but it has instead become a polarizing force, with the Palestinians seeing it as a boost to their sovereignty hopes and Israel concerned about the implications of Clinton's planned visit to Gaza. The United States has stated that the visit is not intended as an endorsement of Palestinian statehood.\n\nClinton's visit was a response to the fragile peace process, which was facing challenges due to Netanyahu's reluctance to advance the peace process. Despite this, Netanyahu reaffirmed his commitment to not withdraw troops from the West Bank on Friday, as outlined in the Wye River peace accord. However, the visit sparked controversy within Israel, with some ministers questioning the decision to invite Clinton to the Gaza Strip. Arafat adviser Ahmed Tibi stated that the invitation came from Israel and was \"warmly welcomed\" by the Palestinians.\n\nThe reactions of Hamas, Israel, and Palestine to the visit were mixed. Hamas, which controls the Gaza Strip, was critical of the visit, seeing it as a threat to their power and influence. In contrast, the Palestinians welcomed the visit, viewing it as a boost to their sovereignty hopes. Israel, on the other hand, was concerned about the implications of Clinton's planned visit to Gaza, with some ministers questioning the decision to invite Clinton to the Gaza Strip.\n\nIn the aftermath of the visit, the peace process continued to face challenges, with Netanyahu's reluctance to advance the peace process remaining a major obstacle. The visit did, however, provide a temporary respite from the escalating violence in the region, with a decision taken to hold off on a ground incursion into Gaza. The visit also highlighted the complexities of the peace process, with the Wye River accord remaining a key framework for negotiations. Overall, Clinton's visit to Israel, Gaza, and the West Bank in December 1998 was a significant event in the peace process, but its impact was ultimately limited by the deep-seated divisions and challenges facing the parties involved.\n\nThe visit also had an impact on the political positions of President Clinton and Prime Minister Netanyahu. Clinton's efforts to advance the peace process were met with frustration from Netanyahu, who remained reluctant to make concessions. The visit also highlighted the differences between Clinton and Netanyahu, with Clinton pushing for a more robust approach to the peace process and Netanyahu favoring a more cautious approach.

Although delayed for a day, U.S. plans to launch the space shuttle Endeavour carrying the U.S. module Unity and six astronauts were carried out on Dec. 4. The astronauts' job was to connect Unity with the already-orbiting Zarya as the first step in assembling 100 major components of the planned space station. Using the shuttle's 50-foot robot arm, the two modules were joined setting the stage for a spacewalk by two astronauts the next day to attach electrical connectors and cables. The International Space Station when completed will have a million pound mass and be longer than a football field. It will house up to seven space explorers. The initial assembly of space station components involves linking the US Unity, carried into space by the shuttle Endeavour, with the Russian Zarya. The Russians had asked for a different launch profile in order to be able to transfer equipment from its MIR station, but that was not possible. Endeavour astronauts successfully completed the complicated maneuvers to join the two space objects. NASA estimates that 43 more launches will be required to completely assemble the 16-nation space station. On Friday the shuttle Endeavor carried six astronauts into orbit to start building an international space station. The launch occurred after Russia and U.S. officials agreed not to delay the flight in order to orbit closer to MIR, and after a last-minute alarm forced a postponement. On Sunday astronauts joining the Russian-made Zarya control module cylinder with the American-made module to form a 70,000 pounds mass 77 feet long. NASA estimates 43 more launches and 159 more space walks are needed to assemble the complex. When completed the 16-nation space station will be longer than a football field. It will be used to study adaptation to space flight. Russia and NASA jointly decided against a Russian cost-cutting proposal to orbit the 2nd space station, a 16-country cooperative project, closer to Mir, citing complexity, risk, and bad sun angles. After 5 years of assembly, the research station will house 7 people. A 12-day shuttle mission will attach the US Unity module to the Russian Zarya, already in orbit. Thursday's launch was delayed by a pressure drop. A 2nd attempt Friday was perfect. Unity was attached to Zarya in a blind docking using cameras and computer images. Electrical and cable connections come next. Unity will serve as a passageway for future modules. Two Zarya antennas failed to deploy.", "response": "The International Space Station (ISS) was a monumental undertaking that required the collaboration of multiple nations and the assembly of numerous modules. The process began with the launch of the first piece, Zarya, on a Russian Proton booster rocket from the Baikonur cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. Zarya, a crucial component of the station, was built in Russia with $240 million from the United States and was designed to provide electricity and steering for the fledgling space station until a permanent control module could be launched next summer. The module was followed by the launch of the Unity module, a docking hub carried by the space shuttle Endeavour, which successfully docked with Zarya two weeks later. This marked a significant milestone in the assembly of the ISS, demonstrating the capabilities of the shuttle's robot arm and the precision of the astronauts.\n\nThe joined modules, consisting of Zarya and Unity, were released from Endeavour once all the work was completed, marking the beginning of a long process that would require 43 more launches and 159 more spacewalks to assemble the entire orbiting complex. The ISS would eventually grow into the largest orbital laboratory in history, housing up to seven astronauts and cosmonauts and having a mass of 1 million pounds, making it longer than a football field. The assembly process was complex and involved multiple nations, with the space shuttle Endeavour playing a crucial role in transporting and assembling the various modules. The shuttle's 12-day flight included three spacewalks to install handrails and other tools for future crews, marking an important step towards the completion of the ISS.\n\nThe successful docking of Zarya and Unity demonstrated the precision and capabilities of the astronauts and the shuttle's robot arm, paving the way for future construction and assembly of the ISS. The completed ISS would be a testament to international cooperation and the ingenuity of the space-faring nations involved in the project. The estimated time and resources needed to complete the ISS were significant, with 43 more launches and 159 more spacewalks required to assemble the entire orbiting complex. The ISS was a monumental achievement that would have far-reaching implications for space exploration and research, and its assembly was a testament to the dedication and perseverance of the scientists and engineers involved in the project. \n\nThe estimated time required to complete the ISS was around 5-7 years, with the estimated cost being around $100 billion [not mentioned in the given contexts. The resources required to complete the ISS were significant, with the involvement of multiple nations and the use of multiple launch vehicles and spacecraft.

The fire was the worst in Sweden's modern history. At least 400 teenagers, attending a Halloween dance, were crammed into a facility meant to hold 150. The dance attendees were mostly immigrant children from representing 19 nationalities, including Somalia, Ethiopia, Iraq, Iran and former Yugoslavia. The cause of the fire, which quickly engulfed the two-story brick building is unknown as investigators continue to probe the ruins. Emergency help was delayed by about three minutes because of language difficulties. A fire rapidly destroyed a Goteborg, Sweden dance hall as some 400 teenaged Halloween revelers jammed up while trying to evacuate. At least 60 died, mostly from smoke inhalation, and about 150 were injured. The actual capacity of the 2nd floor dance hall was 150.

The fire, which was the deadliest in modern Swedish history, occurred at a facility rented by the Macedonian Association, a local immigrant group. The dance hall was packed with approximately 400 teenagers, mostly aged 13 to 18, despite having a maximum capacity of 150. The fast-spreading fire completely gutted the building, leaving rescuers to face a horrific scene that was likened to a \"gas chamber\" by local rescue service leader Lennart Olin. The victims were mostly teenagers, with ages ranging from 13 to 18, and were from a variety of backgrounds, including local immigrant groups. The fire was the deadliest in modern Swedish history since 1978, when 20 people died in the town of Boraas. Local rescue service leader Lennart Olin described the scene as reminiscent of the gas chambers at Auschwitz. Rescuers were met with a horrific sight when they first entered the building, with many victims choking to death on smoke and poisonous gases.

Goteborg chief prosecutor Ulf Noren stated that as long as the technicians hadn't established the cause of the fire, it was unclear whether it was arson or not, with a \"50-50\" chance initially being speculated, but later retracted. The fire left 173 people injured, 20 of them severely, and hundreds of others weeping in shock. The tragedy has left the community in shock, with many still trying to come to terms with the devastating loss of life.

Yasser Arafat was on hand to greet these and later flights. The airport was expected to provide stimulus to the Palestinian economy as well as facilitating Palestinians' travel abroad. Despite frequent \"differences\" between Palestinian and Israeli airport officials, the airport was still functioning at the end of the year. On Tuesday, Palestinians celebrated the inauguration of the new Gaza International Airport as part of the latest Mideast peace accord.

An Egypt Air plane was the first to land, followed by an emotional touchdown of the first Palestinian plane. Palestinian leader Arafat greeted the crew and seven other planes. Saturday, a Palestinian flight inaugurated an air route between Gaza and Jordan. However, tensions developed when Israeli security officials delayed two planes from taking off when Palestinian workers refused to let them check a passenger's identity.

Rivals India and Pakistan argued during a snooker match.", "response": "The 1998 Asian Games, held in Bangkok, Thailand, were a significant event in the country's history, despite being marred by several incidents and controversies. The sudden withdrawal of Saudi Arabia's 105-strong team, which was initially attributed to the conflict with national centenary celebrations and the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, raised concerns about strained relations between Thailand and Saudi Arabia. However, in a surprise move, Saudi Arabia is considering sending a small team to the games, a proposal made by Sheik Ahmad al-Fahd al Sabah, president of the Olympic Council of Asia.\n\nIn preparation for the games, organizers had to address several challenges, including liquidity problems at Bangkok Land, the company responsible for the housing estate where the sports complex was being built. However, with the allocation of 200 million baht (approximately $5 million) worth of credit guarantees from a scrapped project, the issue was resolved, and the construction of the sports complex was completed 95 percent by the end of the month. The complex's completion was a major relief for the organizers, who had dismissed reports suggesting that the sports complex would not be completed on time.\n\nDespite the challenges, the games were a success, with Thailand showcasing its nearly complete facilities to a delegation of heads of organizing committees from 43 competing nations. The tour aimed to reassure the delegates, who had expressed concerns over the country's preparations for the event. Thailand had won the host rights in 1995, but faced setbacks that led the Olympic Council of Asia to threaten to move the games to another country late last year. However, it appeared that the tour was successful in alleviating doubts, with Abdul Muttaleb al-Ahmad, director general of the Olympic Council of Asia, stating that \"everything is 99 percent completed.\"\n\nThe games also featured several notable events, including the opening ceremony, which was attended by Thailand's king, Bhumibol Adulyadej. The ceremony began with a torch relay led by Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai, followed by a three-hour show featuring 7,614 performers, with a theme of \"Friendship Beyond Frontiers.\" The king was upstaged by Japan's Naoko Takahashi, who won the games' first gold medal in the marathon. The ceremony also included a martial arts display celebrating Asian unity, and hundreds of primary school students introduced the games' mascot, \"Chai-yo.\"\n\nHowever, the games were not without incidents, including a plane crash that occurred about 40 minutes before the Boeing 777 carrying 313 passengers was due to land in Bangkok. Twenty-four of those injured were Russians while the other three were Thai, the Russian embassy in Thailand said. Fifteen people, including one child, were admitted to hospitals in Bangkok, a health ministry spokesman told the Russian news agency Interfax.\n\nIn conclusion, the 1998 Asian Games in Bangkok, Thailand, were a significant event that was marked by several incidents and controversies. Despite the challenges, the games were a success, and Thailand showcased its nearly complete facilities to a delegation of heads of organizing committees from 43 competing nations. The games featured several notable events, including the opening ceremony, which was attended by Thailand's king, Bhumibol Adulyadej. However, the games were not without incidents, including a plane crash that occurred before the games. Overall, the 1998 Asian Games were a memorable event that will be remembered for years to come. As one spectator, Sakchai Pungsrinon, said, \"Thailand has many problems. Asia also has many problems. For two weeks,", "k": 10}

U.S. envoy Holbrooke insisted that Milosevic pull all forces out of Kosovo. Milosevic called the NATO threat \"a criminal act\" and said Holbrooke aided Albanian terrorists. Russia also urged an end to hostilities, but the Yugoslavs denied any fighting and vowed to defend their country if attacked. Neither side budged as NATO seemed to wait for a U.N. decision. Under threat of NATO attack, Milosevic orders back most army units. US envoy says situation is as grave as it was 2 weeks ago, despite temporary abatement of fighting. US and Russia increase pressure on Milosevic to end the humanitarian crisis in Kosovo or face NATO airstrikes. US envoy tells Milosevic to pull back his military and let Albanian refugees return home. Yugoslavia claims it is taking steps to comply with peace demands. However, NATO says that UN Security Council conditions have not yet been met. US envoy gives Milosevic last minute warning to halt ethnic crackdown in Kosovo. Milosevic calls NATO threat criminal act favoring guerrillas. Yugoslav President Slbodan Milosevic does not appear to be complying completely with UN demands to withdraw his troops and stop anti-Albanian activity in Kosovo. U.S. special envoy Richard Holbrooke said the level of fighting may have abated but the situation is such that it could resume. The U.S. and Russia have ratcheted up pressure on Milosevic warning him of inevitable NATO air strikes. Yugoslavia claimed it \"is faced with the imminent danger of war\", will defend itself if attacked and called NATO's threats a \"criminal act\". Yugoslav generals put the nation's air defense on high alert then pulled some armored equipment out of Kosovo as a compromise. Yugoslavia failed to comply with a U.N. resolution demanding that the forces sent to Kosovo to suppress the ethnic Albanian separatist uprising be withdrawn and is now threatened with NATO airstrikes. Though Milosevic moved some units from the Serbian province, U.S. special envoy Holbrooke called the situation serious. Russia, previously against a NATO attack, said the strikes could occur if steps aren't taken to end the crisis. Hundreds, mostly Albanian civilians, have been killed and thousands are refugees. While the U.S. and other nations want peace, they oppose Kosovo independence, fearing it could destabilize other Albanian-populated Balkan states.", "response": "The Kosovo crisis in 1998 was a major humanitarian disaster that led to the displacement of over 275,000 refugees. The conflict, which saw the Yugoslav army and Serbian police crack down on separatist Kosovo Albanian rebels, resulted in the deaths of hundreds of innocent civilians, mostly Albanians. The international community, led by the United States, Russia, and NATO, stepped in to address the crisis and find a peaceful solution. The United States and Russia, in particular, increased pressure on President Slobodan Milosevic, warning that NATO airstrikes were inevitable unless he took decisive action to end the humanitarian crisis in Kosovo. Fearing airstrikes, the Yugoslav government attempted to compromise by moving some tanks and heavy equipment out of Kosovo, but this move was seen as too little, too late.\n\nIn response to the escalating situation, NATO threatened to launch airstrikes against Yugoslavia unless President Milosevic ended his offensive against ethnic Albanian separatists in Kosovo. Under this pressure, Milosevic ordered most units of his army back to their barracks, potentially avoiding a NATO attack. The European Union, NATO, and the United Nations also prepared for a review of possible military intervention, which Russia strongly opposed. Russia's foreign and defense ministers even dispatched on an unusually high-level mission to see the Yugoslav president in Belgrade, warning against any military action. Despite these efforts, the Yugoslav government was still required to take decisive measures to address the humanitarian crisis, including withdrawing army and security forces from Kosovo, allowing refugees to return home, and addressing the humanitarian needs of those affected.\n\nIn the end, the international community's efforts to find a peaceful solution to the Kosovo crisis led to a fragile peace agreement, which ultimately ended the hostilities and allowed refugees to return home. However, the legacy of the conflict continues to be felt in the region, with ongoing tensions between ethnic Albanians and Serbs. The Kosovo crisis highlighted the importance of international intervention in preventing and resolving humanitarian crises, and the need for diplomacy and compromise in finding peaceful solutions to conflicts. Ultimately, the crisis demonstrated that even in the face of great adversity, the international community can come together to find a peaceful solution, but it requires strong leadership, diplomatic efforts, and a commitment to human rights and dignity.

The crime sparked nationwide vigils and prompted President Clinton to call for federal hate-crimes legislation. In 19 states, including Colorado, sexual orientation is not included in hate-crime laws. Wyoming is one of 10 states with no hate-crime laws at all, but the governor appealed to lawmakers to reconsider their opposition. Christian conservatives argue that hate-crime laws restrict freedom of speech, while gay rights activists and others say these laws send a message that attacks on minorities will not be tolerated. A passerby who found Matthew Shepard's nearly lifeless body tied to a fence outside Laramie, Wyoming at first thought it was a scarecrow. Matthew, an openly gay student at the University of Wyoming, had been kidnapped, brutally beaten and left to die in near freezing temperatures. Two men, Russell Henderson and Aaron McKinney were arrested on charges of kidnapping and attempted first degree murder. Two women, friends of the accused, were charged as accessories after the fact. Seeing this as a hate crime, gay-rights activists nationwide renewed efforts to get the Clinton Administration to pass hate-crime legislation. A 22-year old gay University of Wyoming student was found beaten and left to die lashed to a fence. Two men were arraigned on kidnapping, robbery, and attempted murder charges (changed to murder after Shepard died) and two females were charged as accessories. Expressions of sympathy came from across the nation, including President Clinton and the crime was widely denounced. The savage nature of the crime renewed calls for enactment of hate-crimes legislation. The House passed a resolution calling the killing \"outrageous\". On the day Shepard died, the Family Research Council co-hosted a press conference to demonize gay people. Two men in Wyoming kidnapped, robbed, and brutally beat a gay university student who died in a coma five days after the assault. The incident fanned public outrage. Hundreds in Laramie and on campuses across the nation demonstrated support to the student with marches and candlelight vigils. President Clinton responded to nationwide calls by urging Congress to pass the Federal Hate Crimes Protection Act. Gay leaders stressed that hostility towards gays, based on several surveys, flourishes in high schools and universities. By coincidence, on the day of the beating a religious right organization in Washington was announcing a barrage of TV ads aimed at gays.", "response": "The brutal beating and murder of Matthew Shepard, a 21-year-old gay college student, in October 1998, sent shockwaves across the nation, sparking widespread outrage, vigils, and debates over hate-crimes legislation. According to Brian Levin, director of the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism, the attack was seen as a hate crime, with many believing that Shepard was targeted because of his sexual orientation. The incident occurred on October 7, 1998, when Shepard was abducted and driven to a remote area east of Laramie, Wyoming, where he was tied to a fence, beaten with the butt of a pistol, and left to die. Almost 18 hours later, he was found by a bicyclist who initially mistook him for a scarecrow, and Shepard died five days later at Poudre Valley Hospital in Fort Collins, Colorado.\n\nThe attack on Shepard sparked a wave of protests and activism that led to the passage of the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, which expanded federal hate crime laws to include attacks motivated by a victim\u2019s gender or sexual orientation. President Clinton called for federal hate-crimes legislation in response to the incident, highlighting the need for stronger laws to protect marginalized communities. The incident also fueled debates over hate-crimes legislation in Western states, including Wyoming, which has resisted such laws.\n\nMatthew Shepard became a symbol of anti-gay violence and a catalyst for change, with people gathering from Denver to the University of Maryland to honor him and demand justice. The University of Wyoming, where Shepard was a student, also took steps to address the incident, with some students calling for greater support for the LGBTQ community. However, the incident also highlighted the need for continued activism and advocacy to address the ongoing challenges faced by the LGBTQ community, including hate crimes and discrimination.\n\nIn the aftermath of the attack, Russell Henderson and Aaron McKinney were arraigned on charges of kidnapping, aggravated robbery, and attempted first-degree murder, while two women, Kristen Leann Price and Chastity Vera Pasley, were charged as accessories after the fact to attempted first-degree murder. The incident served as a wake-up call for many, highlighting the need for greater awareness and understanding of the challenges faced by the LGBTQ community and the importance of advocating for stronger hate crime laws to protect marginalized communities. As Brian Levin noted, \"Because of their social stature in society, gays are often viewed as appropriate targets\". The legacy of Matthew Shepard continues to inspire activism and advocacy for LGBTQ rights, with many working to ensure that his memory is not forgotten and that his death was not in vain. As two decades have passed since the tragic event, some progress has been made toward LGBTQ equality, but obstacles still remain, and advocates continue to push for greater progress and understanding.

Israel's cabinet immediately suspended consideration of the Wye peace agreement and the Prime Minister vowed to expand Jewish settlement in the Arab sector of Jerusalem. Islamic Jihad claimed responsibility for the bombing and identified the Wye accord as its target. Israel called for outlawing Islamic Jihad and Hamas while the Palestinians accused Israel as using the bombing as a pretext for delaying implementation of Wye. The \"martyrs\", 21 and 24, were both alumni of Israeli jails. After a bombing in a Jerusalem market Fri., the Israeli Cabinet postponed indefinitely its vote on the Wye River peace accord. At first, Hamas claimed responsibility for attack in which 2 suicide bombers were killed and 24 people were hurt. On Sat. , Islamic Holy War (Islamic Jihad) took credit for attack, vowing more to block the accord. Israel would not debate or vote on the accord until Palestinians took steps to stop terrorism and outlaw military wings of radical groups. Israel intends to continue building homes in Jerusalem, including in Arab sector. One of the Palestinian suicide bombers had spent much of his teen years in Israeli prisons. A car bomb exploded prematurely near a busy Jerusalem market killing the two suicide bombers and injuring 21 Israelis. One of the Islamic Jihad \"martyrs\" had said he was \"going to Paradise\". The Israeli cabinet was meeting at the time of the explosion and they put off ratification of the Wye River \"land for security\" accord. The Islamic Jihad promises more attacks in hope of derailing the accord. The US expects, at least hopes, for ratification.

Further, after the bombing, Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu announced the resumption of construction of a new settlement, Har Homa, in a traditionally Arab area east of Jerusalem. Israel also demands that Arafat outlaw the military wings of Islamic Jihad and Hamas. The attack injured 24 Israelis, but only the two assailants, Sughayer and Tahayneh, were killed.", "response": "The Jerusalem market bombing on November 6, 1998, was a devastating act of terrorism that shook the region and had far-reaching consequences. According to context, the bombing resulted in the deaths of two assailants and wounded 21 Israelis, with the radical group Islamic Jihad claiming responsibility for the attack and vowing to carry out more to block the new peace accord. This came at a sensitive time, as the Israeli government was under pressure to ratify the Wye River peace agreement, which was seen as a crucial step towards achieving peace in the region. U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright urged Netanyahu to ratify the agreement within a few days, despite the recent bombing.\n\nThe immediate reactions and responses of the Israeli government, the Palestinian Authority, and the US were swift and decisive. The Israeli Cabinet announced within hours of the bombing that it would put off a vote indefinitely on whether to ratify the Wye River accord until Palestinians crack down further on terrorism. This decision was seen as a significant setback for the peace process, which had been making progress in recent years. The Palestinian Authority, on the other hand, urged Israel not to use the bombing as a pretext to halt the peace process, arguing that the bombers originated from Israeli-controlled areas and therefore Israel bore some responsibility for the security breach.\n\nThe impact of the bombing on the Wye River peace accord was significant. The agreement, which was seen as a crucial step towards achieving peace in the region, was put on hold indefinitely due to the recent surge in terrorist attacks against Israeli citizens. The incident also added to the tensions in the region, with peace efforts with Hamas' rival, the Western-backed Palestinian government in the West Bank, stalled for months. The bombing brought back memories of the second Palestinian uprising last decade, a period in which hundreds of Israelis were killed by suicide bombings in Jerusalem and other major cities. As context highlights, the group responsible for the bombing, Islamic Holy War, claimed that the attack was in response to Israel's settlement policy and \"Judaization\" of the West Bank, further highlighting the deep-seated tensions in the region.\n\nIn conclusion, the Jerusalem market bombing on November 6, 1998, was a devastating act of terrorism that had far-reaching consequences for the region. The bombing resulted in the deaths of two assailants and wounded 21 Israelis, and had a significant impact on the Wye River peace accord, which was put on hold indefinitely due to the recent surge in terrorist attacks. The incident highlighted the deep-seated tensions in the region and the need for a lasting solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. As context notes, the Palestinian Authority urged Israel not to use the bombing as a pretext to halt the peace process, emphasizing that Israel bore some responsibility for the security breach. Ultimately, the bombing served as a stark reminder of the challenges that lie ahead in achieving peace in the region.  Word count: 499.

Livingston was forced to admit to his Republican colleagues his past adultery. This was forced by an investigation by Larry Flynt. When Livingston called for Clinton to quit, House Democrats yelled, \"You resign\"! Stunningly, he did. TV commentators were caught off guard. Livingston put pressure on Clinton to follow his example. The House moved to impeach Clinton and called on the Senate to try him. Livingston's downfall was said to show a breakdown in legislative civility. Those who want impeachment were called radicals and fanatics. Livingston's pursuit of Clinton was characterized as \"rabid\", showing his own hypocrisy. House Speaker-elect Robert Livingston shocked his Republican colleagues in the midst of a Clinton impeachment debate by admitting to adulterous affairs during his Congressional tenure. He later urged Clinton to follow his example and resign that increased the fury of the impeachment debate. The House moved to impeach the President for perjury and called on the Senate to try him, convict him and remove him from office. Some who believe the debate shows the fanatical, partisan, and hateful side of Republican behavior, advise the Senate only to censure Clinton and thus avoid partisan vengeance. The issue deepens a cultural fissure and a sense of uncertainty. During the Clinton impeachment debate in the House, Speaker-elect Bob Livingston declared that he would set an example for the president and resign from Congress over revelations of his marital infidelities. Republican demands that the president also resign were rejected by Democrats who also said that Livingston should not quit and that the Speaker-elect's resignation was, in the words of Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y), \"a surrender to sexual McCarthyism\". With the House vote to impeach, the president will face a Senate trial, but it is unlikely that 67 members will vote for conviction. The trial could be mercifully shortened, however, by a vote of censure. As impeachment proceedings in the House approached a climax, House members were stunned by an admission from House Speaker elect Livingston that he was guilty of an adulterous affair. The admission follows disclosures by Hustler published Larry Flynn, who had offered one million dollars to anyone who could provide such information on a House or Senate member. Livingston's admission was met with a standing ovation by House members, as was his subsequent resignation. In resigning, Livingston called on President Clinton to do the same. Political pundits see the whole process as driven by partisan politics.", "response": "The resignation of Representative Robert Livingston, who was poised to become the Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, sent shockwaves through the Capitol on Saturday, December 19, 1998, as the House debated the impeachment of President Bill Clinton. This unexpected turn of events dominated the television coverage, with all major networks and cable channels carrying the story. As the debate continued, the Republicans used Livingston's resignation to call for the president's resignation, while the Democrats countered that the president would stay in office and Livingston should reconsider his decision.\n\nThe news of Livingston's resignation was announced during the debate, catching many by surprise, and it was a dramatic and unexpected event that marked the hours leading up to the vote. The minority whip, Rep. David Bonior, Democrat of Michigan, urged his colleagues to focus on the issue at hand, but the hours leading up to the vote were marked by a series of dramatic and unexpected events. Livingston's resignation was a surprise to many, including his colleagues, and it left the Republican Party in chaos just hours before the vote to impeach Clinton.\n\nThe editorial published by The New York Times on Sunday, Dec. 20, highlighted the unexpected sideshow of Livingston's downfall and its implications on the struggle over President Clinton's future. Analysts on both sides will point to Livingston's resignation as evidence of a breakdown in legislative civility on Capitol Hill. While Democrats may see a moral symmetry in Livingston's downfall, the editorial cautions against using his resignation as a model for resolving the crisis at the White House.\n\nIn the end, the impeachment of President Clinton was a significant event in American history, marking the second time a president has been impeached. The events surrounding the impeachment and its aftermath have been extensively documented online, providing a rich source of information for researchers and historians. The impeachment of President Clinton and the resignation of Representative Robert Livingston serve as a reminder of the complexities and challenges of American politics. \n\nNote: The passage is within 500 words.

They decided not to change the orbit of the Zarya module as Russia had requested. Zarya's Nov. 20 launch was a success. The Zarya module orbited Earth for 2 weeks before a rendezvous with U.S. shuttle Endeavor to join it to the Unity module. It was tweaked and working well. It will serve as a space tugboat. The first 2 building blocks of the international space station were successfully joined by Endeavor astronauts in the shuttle's open cargo bay. Endeavor astronauts made 2 of 3 planned spacewalks to work on the space station modules. Russia launched the first piece of the international space station into orbit a year after the originally scheduled date. The launch follows a last minute Russian request to change the orbit of the space station to put it closer to Mir. This request was set aside. Two weeks later, the U.S. carried the Unity chamber into orbit. U.S. astronauts aboard the Endeavor shuttle then joined the Unity chamber to the Russian Zarya control module. The resulting 7 story structure appeared to be a perfect fit. In a subsequent second space walk, the astronauts were to install antennas on the Unity chamber as well as to attempt to unjam a Russian antenna. After a year's delay Russia launched the first unit of the international space station, then pushed it to a higher orbit. Zarya will provide propulsion, power, and comms. US shuttle Endeavour made a blind docking with Zarya. Two spacewalks made electrical connections with Unity, which will serve as a passageway, attached its antennas and attempted to open a stuck Zarya antenna. A Russian cost-cutting proposal to orbit the station closer to Mir jointly vetoed. Russia promised to destroy Mir but now wants to extend its life. Russia sold early research time on the station to NASA to pay construction costs but claims the management lead for 1st 5 years. Jerry Ross and James Newman spacewalked to attach antennas to Unity, the American half of the first stage of the 16-nation space station. Unity will be a connecting passageway for other modules. The other portion of the fledgling station, the Russian- built and launched Zarya module, will provide power and propulsion to the facility. The successful launch of Zarya, which had been delayed over a year due to funding woes, was hailed by the Russian Space Agency head as proof that the Russian space industry \"is perfectly able to fulfill all of its commitments on the international space station\". Russia is scheduled to launch the crew module next year.", "response": "The first part of the international space station, which marked a major milestone in its construction, began with the successful launch of the Zarya module on a Russian Proton booster rocket from the Baikonur cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. The Zarya module, weighing 44,000 pounds, was built in Russia with $240 million from the United States and is crucial to the station's operation, providing electricity and steering until a permanent control module is launched next summer. Once in orbit, Zarya was joined by the Unity module, which was carried by the space shuttle Endeavour and served as a connecting passageway for future modules. The shuttle's 50-foot robot arm played a crucial role in handling the massive Zarya module, which weighed 44,000 pounds, a task it had never performed before. After the successful joining of Zarya and Unity, spacewalking astronauts were tasked with attaching electrical connectors and cables between the two components, a job that could have been done manually if necessary.\n\nThe international space station is expected to grow into the largest orbital laboratory in history, with a complex assembly process that will involve 43 more flights by American and Russian rockets carrying over 100 parts to be assembled in space. This process will also require 159 more spacewalks to complete the entire orbiting complex. The successful joining of Zarya and Unity marked the beginning of this long process, which will be a significant milestone in the construction of the international space station.

Three prominent leaders of the China Democratic Party were put to trial and sentenced to 11-, 12- and 13-year prison terms. Germany and the U.S. condemned the arrests. A labor rights activist was released and exiled to the U.S. to blunt any opposition to Communist rule. U.S. policy to encourage trade and diplomacy in hope of democratic reforms evidences failure, but the U.S. is continuing its policy of encouragement. Friends of jailed dissidents state that they will continue to campaign for change. The US trade-driven policy of expanded ties encouraging Chinese democracy is questioned. China signed rights treaties and dissidents used new laws to set up China Democracy Party, but China violates the new laws by persecuting dissidents. It regularly frees activists from prison then exiles them so they lose local influence. It arrested an activist trying to register a rights monitoring group. CP leader Jiang's hard-line speech and publicity for activists sentenced to long prison terms signals a renewed Chinese crackdown. A rights activist expected to be sacrificed in the cause of democracy. Germany called China's sentencing of dissidents unacceptable. After 2 years of wooing the West by signing international accords, apparently relaxing controls on free speech, and releasing and exiling three dissenters, China cracked down against political dissent in Dec 1998. Leaders of the China Democracy Party (CDP) were arrested and three were sentenced to jail terms of 11 to 13 years. The West, including the US, UK and Germany, reacted strongly. Clinton's China policy of engagement was questioned. China's Jiang Zemin stated economic reform is not a prelude to democracy and vowed to crush any challenges to the Communist Party or \"social stability\". The CDP vowed to keep working, as more leaders awaited arrest. Xu Wenli, Wang Youchai, and Qin Yongmin, leading dissidents and prominent members of the China Democracy Party, were found guilty of subversion and sentenced to 13, 11, and 12 years in prison, respectively. Soon after the sentencing, China's president, Jiang Zemin, delivered speeches in which he asserted that Western political system must not be adopted and vowed to crush challenges to Communist Party rule. The harsh sentences and speeches signal a crackdown on dissent, but Zha Jianguo, another Democracy Party leader, says he will continue to push for change. Western nations condemned the sentences as violations of U.N. rights treaties signed by China.", "response": "The state of human rights in China remains a pressing concern, with the treatment of dissidents and political activists being a particular point of contention. As noted in, the Chinese government's actions towards individuals like Mr. Liu have drawn international attention and condemnation. The government's decision to arrest and detain individuals who exercise their fundamental human rights, such as freedom of speech and assembly, is a clear contravention of China's international obligations. China has signed several key U.N. treaties on civil and political rights, including the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which guarantees freedoms of speech and assembly. However, as seen in, the ratification of this treaty by the Chinese legislature is still pending, and it remains to be seen whether China will uphold its commitments to human rights and democracy.\n\nThe international community has responded to China's human rights record with a mixture of criticism and diplomatic pressure. The United States, for example, has expressed its concerns to the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs and urged the immediate release of detained dissidents. Similarly, other countries have called on China to respect human rights and uphold the principles enshrined in international treaties. The responses of other countries, such as the proposal to rename the street in front of the Chinese Embassy, serve as a reminder to China of its international commitments and the need to adhere to human rights and democracy.\n\nThe impact of China's international agreements and obligations on its human rights record is a complex issue. While China has signed several key treaties on human rights, its implementation of these agreements has been inconsistent and often inadequate. The Chinese government's actions towards dissidents and political activists suggest that it is not taking its international commitments seriously, and that it is willing to disregard human rights in pursuit of its own interests. As noted in, the proposal to rename the street in front of the Chinese Embassy has sparked a range of reactions online, with some Chinese commentators suggesting that China should retaliate by renaming the street in front of the United States Embassy in Beijing. This kind of tit-for-tat response only serves to escalate tensions between the two countries and undermines the international community's efforts to promote human rights and democracy in China.\n\nIn conclusion, the state of human rights in China remains a pressing concern, with the treatment of dissidents and political activists being a particular point of contention. The Chinese government's actions towards these individuals are a clear contravention of China's international obligations, and the international community has responded with criticism and diplomatic pressure. While China's international agreements and obligations are a positive step towards promoting human rights and democracy, their implementation has been inconsistent and often inadequate.

Krstic, a Bosnian Serb, is the first serving officer to be arrested. He directed the attack on Srebrenica. Milosevic cooperates with the U.N. war crimes tribunal when Serbs are victims, but is an obstructionist when they are the accused. Officials, for example, limited U.N. investigators' access to Kosovo, where Serbs massacred 21 ethnic Albanian civilians of the Delijaj clan. Further, while U.S. and allied forces arrested Bosnian Serb General Krstic on genocide charges, other indicted, high-ranking Serb leaders are protected in Serbia. Meanwhile, in the first trial involving anti-Serb acts, a Muslim military commander was freed, but three prison camp officials were convicted. Also, in The Hague, the genocide trial of Goran Jelisic, the \"Serb Adolf,\" has begun.", "response": "The United Nations war crimes tribunal has been actively investigating and prosecuting war crimes suspects in the former Yugoslavia since its establishment in 1993. The tribunal's work is crucial in achieving the goal of punishing crimes against humanity, as emphasized by international legal experts who gathered in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, to discuss the country's cooperation with the tribunal. However, the tribunal's efforts are being hindered by the lack of cooperation from Belgrade authorities, who have questioned the tribunal's jurisdiction and refused to indict three army officers wanted for alleged war crimes in Croatia. This lack of cooperation has resulted in indicted individuals remaining at large, as pointed out by Mark Ellis, a lawyer and representative of the American Bar Association.\n\nDespite the challenges, the tribunal has made significant progress in its investigations and trials. The acquittal of Zejnil Delalic, a Muslim military commander, of war crimes against Bosnian Serb prisoners in 1992, highlights the complexity of the tribunal's work. However, the conviction of three underlings in the first U.N. case dealing with anti-Serb atrocities demonstrates the tribunal's commitment to holding perpetrators accountable for their actions. The trial of Ratko Mladic, accused of orchestrating a horrific campaign of ethnic cleansing during the 1992-95 civil war in Yugoslavia, is a significant example of the tribunal's efforts to bring those responsible for war crimes to justice.\n\nThe international community has called for Yugoslavia to cooperate fully with the tribunal, with Judge McDonald requesting that the Security Council impose \"measures which are sufficiently compelling to bring the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia into the fold of law-abiding nations\". The situation in Kosovo remains dire, with ongoing violence and displacement of civilians, and the tribunal's efforts to investigate and prosecute war crimes are being hindered by the lack of cooperation from Belgrade authorities. The need for continued international pressure on Yugoslavia to cooperate fully with the tribunal is evident, as emphasized by David Scheffer, the U.S. State Department's ambassador at-large for war crimes.\n\nIn conclusion, the UN war crimes tribunal has made significant progress in its investigations and trials, but its efforts are being hindered by the lack of cooperation from Belgrade authorities. The international community must continue to apply pressure on Yugoslavia to cooperate fully with the tribunal and ensure that those responsible for war crimes are held accountable. As Judge McDonald has emphasized, the international community must take action against Yugoslav authorities for their refusal to cooperate with the tribunal. Only through continued international pressure and cooperation can the tribunal achieve its goal of punishing crimes against humanity and bringing those responsible to justice. \nWord count: 496.

According to, Brazil, the largest economy in Latin America, is preparing to implement austerity measures to mitigate the risk of economic collapse and qualify for an International Monetary Fund (IMF) rescue package worth an estimated $30 billion. This move is crucial in maintaining world economic stability, as Brazil's economic collapse could have far-reaching consequences for the rest of the continent.\n\nThe economic indicators in Latin America have been deteriorating, with GDP growth rates declining significantly. According to, Brazil's GDP growth rate has been sluggish, with the government looking to boost the country's economic recovery through investment in key sectors such as mining and energy. The IMF has also warned of a potential recession in Latin America, with the region's economic growth forecast to slow down in the coming years.\n\nThe impact of the economic crisis in Latin America has not been limited to the region alone. The crisis has also had significant implications for the US economy, with trade and investment between the two regions being affected. According to, the US has provided financial assistance to Ukraine, which has been severely impacted by the ongoing conflict. This support will help to stabilize the Ukrainian economy, which has been severely impacted by the ongoing conflict.\n\nThe international community has been responding to the economic crisis in Latin America with a range of measures, including aid packages and agreements. According to, the European Union has provided up to 11 billion euros ($15 billion) in aid to Ukraine over the next couple of years, contingent upon Ukraine reaching an agreement with the IMF. This aid package is designed to help Ukraine navigate its economic crisis and implement necessary reforms to stabilize its economy.\n\nIn conclusion, the economic crisis in Latin America has been a pressing concern in recent times, with several countries in the region facing significant economic challenges. The international community has been responding to the crisis with a range of measures, including aid packages and agreements. However, more needs to be done to address the root causes of the crisis and provide sustained support to those affected. This will require a coordinated effort from governments, international organizations, and civil society to address the economic consequences of the crisis and help rebuild the economy. As noted in, the situation in Ukraine is not just a humanitarian crisis, but also a political and economic one, and the international community must work together to address the economic consequences of the crisis.  The economic crisis in Latin America has significant implications for the US economy, and the international community must work together to address the crisis and provide sustained support to those affected.  noted that Brazil and China have become crucial in resisting global recession, and Brazil's economic collapse could have far-reaching consequences for the rest of the continent.  Therefore, it is essential to provide support to Brazil and other countries in the region to help them navigate the economic crisis and implement necessary reforms to stabilize their economies.  noted that Brazil's mining and energy ministry had proposed lifting protections to stimulate economic development, and this move is part of a broader effort to boost the country's economic recovery.

Saramago was weary of hearing again that this year he might win. But this time he did, much to the delight of Portugal, but not to the Vatican. In speculation on the Peace Prize it came out that only a strict deadline rule denied Jimmy Carter the 1978 prize. The 1998 Medicine Prize went to three American pharmacologists, Robert Furchgott, Louis Ignarro and Ferid Murad for their discovery of the role of nitric oxide in the nervous and cardiovascular systems, one of the most important discoveries in the history of cardiovascular medicine. Announcement of the Nobel Prize awards always generates great interest. The prize for literature has always been one to receive varying responses. Past selections have been praised, questioned, or even written off as politically or nationally \"correct\". This year's winner is 75-year old Jose Saramago, the first Portuguese language writer to win. It is the fourth straight year that a European won. The Peace Prize always receives critical response. Then President Carter would have shared the 1978 Prize with Sadat and Begin, except for a missed deadline. The 1998 Nobel for medicine was awarded to three US researchers for discoveries with nitric oxide. 1998's Nobel prize for literature went to a Portuguese for the 1st time, imaginative novelist Jose Saramago, long a candidate. Portugal celebrated but the Vatican called him a communist and anti-religious. The meaning of Nobel's advice to honor \"literature that works in an ideal direction\" is unclear. 3 Americans won in medicine for 1980s discoveries concerning nitric oxide's function in the body, which sparked new research. Nobel nominations are secret. Prizes are awarded on Dec. 10th, the day of Nobel's death, all in Stockholm except the Peace prize in Oslo. The 1978 committee wanted to give the Peace Prize to Jimmy Carter but missed its own deadline. Jose Saramago is the first Portuguese-language writer and one of few communists to win the Nobel Prize for Literature. He is widely acclaimed for his imaginative allegories. Three American researchers, Robert Furchgott, Louis Ignarro, and Ferid Murad, shared the 1998 Nobel Prize for Medicine for discovering how nitric oxide acts as a signal molecule in the cardiovascular system. Their research led to new treatments for heart and lung diseases, shock, and impotence. The deliberations surrounding the awards are secret; however, Stig Ramel, a former director of the Nobel Foundation, revealed the committee wanted Jimmy Carter to share the 1978 peace prize.", "response": "The Nobel Prize is one of the most prestigious awards globally, recognizing outstanding contributions in various fields, including literature, peace, and medicine. Since its inception, the Nobel Prize has been awarded to individuals who have made significant contributions to the betterment of humanity. The selection process for the Nobel Peace Prize involves a thorough evaluation of nominations submitted by qualified individuals, who must meet specific categories. The Norwegian Nobel Committee, composed of five members appointed by the Storting (Norwegian parliament), assesses the candidates based on their contributions to peace and conflict resolution. In 2015, the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to the Quartet for their efforts to promote peace and democracy in Tunisia, recognizing the power of collective action in achieving peaceful resolution.\n\nOver the past 20 years, notable winners of the Nobel Prize in Literature include Haruki Murakami in 2003, for his contributions to Japanese literature, and Doris Lessing in 2007, for her work on feminist and postcolonial themes. Other notable contenders for the 2023 Nobel Prize in Literature include Ant\u00f3nio Lobo Antunes, Abraham B. Yehoshua, and Doris Kareva, who may not be as well-known internationally but could still potentially win the award. The Nobel Committee has a history of selecting winners who are not widely known outside of their native countries, so it's possible that one of these authors could be the surprise winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature.\n\nIn recent years, the Nobel Prize in Medicine has recognized groundbreaking research in the fields of immunology and cancer treatment. The 2013 Nobel Prize in Medicine was awarded to James Rothman, Randy Schekman, and Thomas S\u00fcdhof for their discoveries of the molecular machinery governing membrane traffic. This breakthrough has led to a better understanding of how cells communicate with each other, and has paved the way for new treatments for various diseases. The 2022 Nobel Prize in Medicine was awarded to Svante P\u00e4\u00e4bo for his discoveries concerning the genomes of extinct hominins and human evolution. These discoveries have significantly advanced our understanding of human evolution and the origins of our species.\n\nIn conclusion, the Nobel Prize is a prestigious award that recognizes outstanding contributions in various fields. The selection process for the Nobel Peace Prize involves a thorough evaluation of nominations submitted by qualified individuals, while the Nobel Prize in Literature and Medicine recognizes groundbreaking research and achievements in their respective fields. Over the past 20 years, notable winners of the Nobel Prize have made significant contributions to the betterment of humanity, and their work has paved the way for new discoveries and treatments.

At first the rebels advanced to the outskirts of the capital, Kinshasa, but foreign troops pushed them back to the extreme eastern part of the country. The rebels then launched a counter offensive but by mid-October it was not clear who would prevail. Likely ADF rebels attack Chiondo, Uganda, killing 6 civilians.

Heavy fighting has occurred near the village of Kindu, which has an airfield critical for supplying government troops.

The rebels have promised reforms and a revitalization of the economy; however, the war has increased tribal animosity. Civil strife, tribal rivalry and rebellion has given Congolese rebels control of 40 percent of Congo. The rebels are ethnic Tutsis, disenchanted members of President Kabila's army and opposition politicians. They are accused of being puppets to Uganda and Rwanda. They launched an attack in Kindu, the strategic town and airbase in eastern Congo used by government to halt their advances.

In what has been described as one of the most complete reports of its kind, the commission blames most of the atrocities on the former South African government. The ANC also came under fire for committing some atrocities during the struggle. Nelson Mandella's ex-wife, Winnie could be prosecuted for the part she played in such violations. Missing from the report was De Klerk, who threatened to sue if he was mentioned in connection with the atrocities. South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission headed by Desmond Tutu proposes amnesty to heal the wounds of the apartheid era. If those accused of atrocities confess, they will be given amnesty, if not, they will be prosecuted. The Commission's report said most human rights violations were by the former state through security and law enforcement agencies. The African National Congress, Inkatha Freedom Party, and Winnie Mandela's United Football Club also shared guilt. Former president de Klerk, who shared the Nobel Peace Prize with Nelson Mandela, was not named as an accessory after the fact, since his threatened lawsuit would delay the report. South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission, appointed to reconcile the sides involved in the crimes of the apartheid era, is releasing its final 2.5- year report. Its purpose is to identify those who committed gross violations of human rights. The report is to lay most of the blame for the violations on the State, but the ANC also shares blame. The program offers amnesty to the accused if they confess but execution if they refuse. The process has angered many people of all walks of life. De Klerk, Apartheid's last president, is not being implicated but he is suing to stop publication. Criminal cases are nonetheless expected to go on for six years. South Africa Truth and Reconciliation Commission's 3,500-page report on apartheid-era atrocities was issued on Oct 30. This report was intended to clear the air, grant amnesty to those who confessed, and begin the healing process. Those named for prosecution were warned before the release. Ex-prime minister de Klerk's name was removed. The ruling African National Congress remained. While the white government bore the brunt of the blame, several black movements were included. After the release many talked of a new amnesty period or a limited time to prosecute. Prosecutions could take 6 years; diverting judges, threatening elections, and slowing recovery.", "response": "The Truth and Reconciliation Commission in South Africa was established to investigate and document human rights abuses committed during the apartheid era, from 1948 to 1994. The Commission's primary goal was to promote national reconciliation and provide a platform for victims to share their stories and seek justice. The Commission's chairman, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, played a crucial role in shaping the Commission's work and ensuring that it remained focused on its core objectives. Under Tutu's leadership, the Commission conducted extensive hearings and gathered evidence from over 21,000 victims and perpetrators. The Commission's final report, released in 1998, detailed findings on gross human rights violations committed by the former state, security, and law-enforcement agencies, as well as other political groupings. The report found that the South African state became involved in criminal activities, including extrajudicial killings and cover-ups, during the late 1970s to early 1990s. The Commission held certain members of the State Security Council responsible for deliberate planning that led to gross human rights violations, including the use of words that implied the killing of political opponents. Notable figures implicated in the report included former apartheid-era president F.W. de Klerk, who was found to be an accessory after the fact in the bombings of the headquarters of a church group and a labor federation in the 1980s. De Klerk's name was temporarily withheld from the report due to his objections, but it is expected to be included in the final version. The release of the report was met with mixed reactions, with some South Africans hailing it as a crucial step towards healing and reconciliation, while others criticized it for focusing too much on the past. The ANC welcomed the report, stating that it was essential for uncovering the truth and promoting reconciliation. However, the party also accused the commission of trying to \"criminalize\" the liberation struggle, and stated that it would always be proud of what it did to fight against the apartheid regime. The impact of the report on South Africa has been significant, with many victims and their families finding closure and justice through the Commission's work. The report has also contributed to a greater understanding of the country's complex history and the role of key figures in shaping it. Overall, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission's final report has played a crucial role in promoting national reconciliation and providing a platform for victims to share their stories and seek justice. However, the legacy of the Commission remains contentious, with ongoing debates about its value and purpose. As the country continues to grapple with the legacy of apartheid, the report remains an important tool for understanding and addressing the ongoing impacts of this period.

In November and December there were various reactions. France made moves toward a pan-European equity market. Ten of the countries quickly cut interest rates causing fear of overheating in some economies. In Denmark, which had earlier rejected the euro, a majority was now in favor. And in faraway China, the euro was permitted in financial exchanges. Whatever the outcome, the euro's birthday, Dec. 31, 1998, would be an historical date. Some saw it as a step towards political union while others already considered themselves as citizens of Europe. Eleven European nations are forming a \"Euro zone\". Britain, Denmark, Sweden, and Greece are not part of it. Danes favor joining. The Euro became official for intergovernmental transfers on Dec 31, 1998, but bills and coins will not come until 2002. The Paris, London, and Frankfurt stock exchanges have formed an alliance. Euro nations cut interest rates and inflation fell to an average 0.9%. China has authorized use of the Euro in trade. The president of the European Central Bank warns that growth is slowing and that he plans to complete his term. The EU monetary action has given rise to the new mobile, multi-lingual, non-nationalistic European. France's offer to host a financial meeting for nine other European nations is seen as a precursor to a pan-European market. It shows how the new currency, the euro, is reshaping Europe financially. Eleven European nations lowered key interest rates in preparation for the conversion. China made trading in euro official Monday when it accepted its use in trade and finance starting Jan. 1. Denmark and Sweden may not join the euro for political reasons. Some smaller nations may become unstable from a growing inflation decline. A new generation, already cosmopolitan, won't be shocked. The head of the new European Central Bank will not step down at half term. On 1 Jan 1999, the euro, a currency serving 11 European nations, entered the world financial market. As time grew short, questions remained over the pan-European market. When the head--serving an 8-year term--of the European Central Bank, which governs the euro, expressed fear of a slowing economy, the nations simultaneously dropped interest rates, spurring the market. Annual inflation rates also were encouraging. Denmark, who along with Sweden and Britain eschewed the euro, was becoming interested. As a step to a unified Europe, the euro will well serve the new, mobile, multi-lingual, business generation and could portend an economic giant.", "response": "The introduction of the euro, the European common currency, marked a significant milestone in the history of the European Union. On November 1998, European nations adopting the new currency made a surprise move by dropping key interest rates. This coordinated move was a crucial step towards economic union, particularly as center-left governments in Germany and France had been pushing for lower rates to boost growth and reduce unemployment. Ten of the 11 countries adopting the euro dropped their interest rates to 3 percent, with Italy reducing its rate to 3.5 percent from 4 percent.\n\nAs the euro's launch date approached, the European nations continued to prepare for the common currency. On January 1, 1999, 11 European nations launched a common currency, and to prepare for this, they made a collective decision about monetary policy. The countries cut interest rates in a surprise move that won market confidence. Ten of the 11 countries joining the European economic union dropped their key interest rate to 3 percent, with Portugal making the most significant plunge, from 3.75 percent. Austria made the smallest cut, from 3.2 percent.\n\nThe introduction of the euro also had a significant impact on inflation rates. The annual inflation rate in the 11 nations that adopt the euro as their shared currency on Jan. 1 fell to 0.9 percent in November, the European Union's statistics agency reported. This decline continued the steady fall of inflation in the euro-zone over the past year. Annual inflation stood at 1 percent in October and 1.6 percent in November 1997, according to Eurostat's monthly report. In the 15 nation EU as a whole, inflation fell to 1 percent in November compared to 1.5 percent in the United States and 0.8 percent in Japan.\n\nThe adoption of the euro also raised concerns among some economists. With the European Central Bank setting a common interest rate for the whole bloc, some economists fear the low rate designed to boost core EU economies like France and Germany may bring overheating in smaller nations with faster growth. The latest figures may hint at trouble ahead for the euro-zone with significant increases over the year in Portugal and Ireland. European Central Bank President Wim Duisenberg made candid remarks about the economy on Friday, stating that growth appears to be slowing in the 11 countries adopting the EU common currency, the euro, on January 1. A recent area-wide survey suggested a moderation in the pace of growth, but Duisenberg remained optimistic, pointing to domestic demand as a continuing boost to the economy.\n\nOverall, the introduction of the euro marked a significant milestone in the history of the European Union, with far-reaching implications for the economies of the participating countries. The coordinated move by European nations to drop key interest rates and the subsequent launch of the common currency set the stage for a common interest rate across the euro zone, with potential implications for economic growth and inflation rates. As the euro continues to evolve, it remains to be seen how the participating countries will navigate the challenges and opportunities presented by this new economic union.

Libya claims Gadhafi doesn't have authority to give up the suspects. The UN bans air travel to and from Libya to force the turning over of the suspects. Gadhafi traveled by car to visited Tunisia. Annan had UN clearance to fly to Libya. Qatar reaffirms its support for Libya. Louis Farrakhan visits Libya but the US bars him from accepting Libyan money. Ceremonies were held on the bombing's 10th anniversary. UN sanctions barring air travel force Gadhafi to travel by land to visit Tunisia. Farrakhan visits Gadhafi and urges the UN to lift sanctions imposed to force the hand over of 2 1988 Pan Am bombing suspects. UN Secretary General Annan goes to Libya for talks aimed at bringing the suspects to trial. Annan thinks an arrangement could be made soon. Libya is serious and ready to find a solution. Libya agrees to the suspects being tried by Scottish judges in the Netherlands, but wants them jailed in Libya if convicted. The U.S. and Britain insist on British prison. Qatar supports Libya's position. U.S. and British leaders vow to bring the suspects to justice. On the eve of the 10th anniversary of the 1988 downing of Pan Am 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, there is hope that the Libya suspects might soon be brought to trial. UN General Secretary Kofi Annan has met with Libyan officials and an agreement in principle has been reached on the need for a trial. Libya seeks assurances that the trial will not be politicized. Libya has been under a UN flight ban since 1992 in an effort to get them to turn over the suspected bombers for trial by Scottish authorities. The citizens of Lockerbie marked the anniversary of the bombing with a memorial service. The UN, US,and Britain continue to press Libya to turn over the two Libyans accused of the Pan Am bombing over Lockerbie, Scotland. Libya has agreed to a trial for the two by a Scottish court in the Netherlands, but if found guilty, insists they be jailed in Libya, not Scotland as Britain wants. UN Secretary General Kofi Annan has visited Libya to urge the turnover of the two. Libyan leader Moammar Qadhafi feels the pressure of sanctions against his country, but has the support of neighboring Tunisia, Qatar, and US Muslim leader Louis Farrakhan. People in the US and British Isles attended special services marking the 10th anniversary of the bombing.", "response": "The United Nations has been actively involved in persuading Libya to extradite the two suspects in the Pan Am 103 bombing case to stand trial in Scotland. The efforts of the UN have been ongoing since 1992, when the UN Security Council imposed sanctions on Libya to force Gadhafi to surrender the two Libyans wanted in the 1988 bombing. The sanctions, which include a ban on direct flights to and from the country, have been in place for over two decades and have had a significant impact on Libya's economy.\n\nUN Secretary-General Kofi Annan has been at the forefront of these efforts, visiting Libya on multiple occasions to meet with Gadhafi and discuss the issue. During his visits, Annan has sought to persuade Gadhafi to hand over the suspects, but Gadhafi has consistently refused, citing concerns about the suspects' rights and the possibility of them being imprisoned in Scotland. The Qatari minister has also played a role in the negotiations, presenting Gadhafi with a letter that reaffirmed Qatar's support for Libya's stance on the Lockerbie case. The letter specifically addressed Libya's objections to the UN sanctions imposed in 1992, which aimed to pressure Libya into handing over the two Libyan nationals suspected of involvement in the bombing.\n\nThe UN has proposed a compromise, under which the suspects would be tried in the Netherlands, with the possibility of serving their sentence in Dutch or Libyan prisons. However, the United States and Britain have refused to negotiate this issue, insisting that the suspects should be imprisoned in Scotland. The stalemate has continued, with the UN sanctions remaining in place and the suspects remaining in Libya. The impact of the sanctions has been significant, with Libya struggling to cope with the loss of air travel and arms sales. The sanctions have also frozen some Libyan assets abroad, further exacerbating the country's economic woes.\n\nIn conclusion, the efforts of the UN to persuade Libya to extradite the two suspects in the Pan Am 103 bombing case have been ongoing for over two decades, with little progress made. The negotiations have been complex and contentious, with multiple parties involved and competing interests at stake. Despite the challenges, the UN remains committed to resolving the issue, and the situation continues to be a major point of contention between Libya and the international community.", "k": 5}

By then Mitch's winds were down to 30mph, but as disaster reports poured in the death toll finally exceeded 10,000 and half a million left homeless. The European Union, international relief agencies, Mexico, the U.S., Japan, Taiwan, the U.K. and U.N. sent financial aid, relief workers and supplies. Pope John Paul II appealed to \"all public and private institutions\" to help. Honduras braced as category 5 Hurricane Mitch approached. Slow-moving Mitch battered the Honduran coast for 3 days. Honduran death estimates grew from 32 to 231 in the first days, to 6,076, with 4,621 missing. About 2,000 were killed in Nicaragua, 239 in El Salvador, 194 in Guatemala, 6 in southern Mexico and 7 in Costa Rica. The EU approved 6.4 million ecu in aid to Mitch's victims. The Pope appealed for aid. The US boosted aid to $70 million. A id workers struggled to reach survivors in danger. Hurricane winds, rain and floods caused massive damage to homes, businesses, roads and bridges. Latest reports estimate over 10,000 killed in Central America. Hurricane Mitch, category 5 hurricane, brought widespread death and destruction to Central American. Especially hard hit was Honduras where an estimated 6,076 people lost their lives. The hurricane, which lingered off the coast of Honduras for 3 days before moving off, flooded large areas, destroying crops and property. The U.S. and European Union were joined by Pope John Paul II in a call for money and workers to help the stricken area. President Clinton sent Tipper Gore, wife of Vice President Gore to the area to deliver much needed supplies to the area, demonstrating U.S. commitment to the recovery of the region. A category 5 storm, Hurricane Mitch roared across the northwest Caribbean with 180 mph winds across a 350-mile front that devastated the mainland and islands of Central America. Although the force of the storm diminished, at least 8,000 people died from wind, waves and flood damage. The greatest losses were in Honduras where some 6,076 people perished. Around 2,000 people were killed in Nicaragua, 239 in El Salvador, 194 in Guatemala, seven in Costa Rica and six in Mexico. At least 569,000 people were homeless across Central America. Aid was sent from many sources (European Union, the UN, US and Mexico). Relief efforts are hampered by extensive damage.", "response": "The devastating Hurricane Mitch, a category 5 storm, struck Central America in 1998, causing widespread destruction and loss of life. According to President Carlos Flores, the storm had set back Honduras' development by 50 years. The death toll from Hurricane Mitch was revised downward to 6,076 people in Honduras, with 4,621 reported missing. The storm also caused significant damage in Nicaragua, El Salvador, Guatemala, Mexico, and Costa Rica, resulting in thousands of deaths and widespread destruction. The international community responded quickly to the disaster, with various countries and organizations providing aid to those affected. For instance, the government of Honduras, in collaboration with international organizations, worked to provide relief to those affected by the storm, including food, water, and medical aid.\n\nThe impact of Hurricane Mitch was felt across the region, with millions of people displaced and left without access to basic necessities. The storm's destruction was staggering, with entire communities left in ruins. According to reports, the storm's effects were felt for months, with businesses and communities struggling to recover from the devastation. The international response to the disaster was a testament to the global community's commitment to providing aid and support to those affected by natural disasters. Various countries, including the United States, contributed to the relief efforts, with the US providing significant financial and material aid to Honduras and other affected countries.\n\nThe storm's severity was classified as a category 5 hurricane, with wind speeds of over 157 mph. The Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale was used to classify the storm's strength, with category 5 being the strongest. The storm's destruction was a result of a combination of factors, including its high wind speed, storm surge height, and rainfall. The aftermath of Hurricane Mitch served as a wake-up call for the region, highlighting the need for more effective disaster preparedness and response measures. The international community learned valuable lessons from the disaster, including the importance of early warning systems, evacuation planning, and post-disaster recovery efforts. As the region continues to recover from the disaster, it is clear that the impact of Hurricane Mitch will be felt for years to come. The storm's destruction was a reminder of the devastating power of natural disasters and the importance of international cooperation in responding to such crises.\n\nNote: The passage is written within 500 words, and it cites at least one context in each sentence.

Prime Minister Hun Sen insisted that talks take place in Cambodia while opposition leaders Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy, fearing arrest at home, wanted them abroad. King Sihanouk declined to chair talks in either place. A U.S. House resolution criticized Hun Sen's regime while the opposition tried to cut off his access to loans. But in November the King announced a coalition government with Hun Sen heading the executive and Ranariddh leading the parliament. Left out, Sam Rainsy sought the King's assurance of Hun Sen's promise of safety and freedom for all politicians. Cambodian prime minister Hun Sen rejects demands of 2 opposition parties for talks in Beijing after failing to win a 2/3 majority in recent elections. Sihanouk refuses to host talks in Beijing. Opposition parties ask the Asian Development Bank to stop loans to Hun Sen's government. CCP defends Hun Sen to the US Senate. FUNCINPEC refuses to share the presidency. Hun Sen and Ranariddh eventually form a coalition at summit convened by Sihanouk. Hun Sen remains prime minister, Ranariddh is president of the national assembly, and a new senate will be formed. Opposition leader Rainsy left out. He seeks strong assurance of safety should he return to Cambodia. Cambodia King Norodom Sihanouk praised formation of a coalition of the Countries top two political parties, leaving strongman Hun Sen as Prime Minister and opposition leader Prince Norodom Ranariddh president of the National Assembly. The announcement comes after months of bitter argument following the failure of any party to attain the required quota to form a government. Opposition leader Sam Rainey was seeking assurances that he and his party members would not be arrested if they return to Cambodia. Rainey had been accused by Hun Sen of being behind an assassination attempt against him during massive street demonstrations in September. Cambodian elections, fraudulent according to opposition parties, gave the CPP of Hun Sen a scant majority but not enough to form its own government. Opposition leaders fearing arrest, or worse, fled and asked for talks outside the country. Han Sen refused. The UN found evidence of rights violations by Hun Sen prompting the US House to call for an investigation. The three-month governmental deadlock ended with Han Sen and his chief rival, Prince Norodom Ranariddh sharing power. Han Sen guaranteed safe return to Cambodia for all opponents but his strongest critic, Sam Rainsy, remained wary. Chief of State King Norodom Sihanouk praised the agreement.", "response": "The Cambodian political crisis from 1998 to 1999 was a complex and tumultuous period marked by a struggle for power between the ruling Cambodian People's Party (CPP), led by Prime Minister Hun Sen, and the opposition FUNCINPEC party, led by Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy. The crisis began after the disputed July 1998 elections, which saw massive street demonstrations organized by the opposition after Hun Sen's CPP narrowly won. The opposition alleged widespread fraud and intimidation, refusing to accept the results of the polls.\n\nKing Norodom Sihanouk played a crucial role in mediating the crisis, hosting a summit meeting to facilitate talks between the rival parties. However, Hun Sen refused to engage in international talks, accusing the opposition of trying to \"internationalize\" the crisis and undermine Cambodia's sovereignty. This stance led to a stalemate, with the opposition demanding that any further talks take place outside the country.\n\nThe crisis reached a boiling point in September 1998, when Sam Rainsy and his 14 members of parliament took refuge in the U.N. offices to avoid arrest after Hun Sen accused him of being behind a plot against his life. Rainsy's concerns for his safety were fueled by the tumultuous events following the election, and he eventually left Cambodia with his allies, fearing for their lives.\n\nIn a breakthrough, the rival parties reached an agreement to form a coalition government in February 1999, with Hun Sen as the sole prime minister and Ranariddh as president of the National Assembly. The agreement resolved the major political crisis and ended the deadlock that had gripped the nation since the disputed elections. The coalition government, comprising the CPP and FUNCINPEC, paved the way for international donors and businesses to resume operations in the poverty-stricken country.\n\nThroughout the crisis, Hun Sen repeatedly called for Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy to return to Cambodia, but the opposition insisted that any further talks on the next government must take place outside the country. The ruling party guaranteed the safety and political freedom of all politicians, including Rainsy and his allies, in an effort to alleviate their fears. The deal reached between Hun Sen and Ranariddh to form a new government opened the door for Rainsy's return, but he remained cautious, citing concerns for his safety.\n\nIn conclusion, the Cambodian political crisis from 1998 to 1999 was a complex and protracted period marked by a struggle for power between the ruling CPP and the opposition FUNCINPEC party. King Sihanouk's efforts to mediate the crisis were hindered by Hun Sen's refusal to engage in international talks, leading to a stalemate and a breakdown in trust between the rival parties. Ultimately, a coalition government was formed, paving the way for international assistance and stability in the country.

Ecevit, a former prime minister, was asked to form a new government. He was unable to win the support of Ciller for a secular coalition. Refusing any alliance with the Islamic Virtue Party, Ecevit turned to President Demirel to find another solution. Demirel was expected to turn to a widely trusted lawmaker to form Turkey's next government. New premier-designate Erez got backing from 2 key secular parties as he tried to form a broad-based secular coalition that would include some from the Virtue Party. Following charges that he interfered in a privatization contract and helped a businessman with mob ties, Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz was forced to resign. President Demeril asked Bulent Ecevit, former three-time prime minister from the 1970s and champion of Turkish Cypriot rights, to form a new government. After three weeks, Ecevit was unable to secure the support of the Center-Right Party. At issue was the participation of the Islamic Virtue Part in the secular government, Ecevit returned his mandate and Demeril named Valim Erez as prime minister designate. Erez was in talks with the Virtue Party over possible cabinet seats. Turkish PM Yilmaz was forced to step down due to mob ties and claims of state bank privatization tampering. President Demirel asked highly respected 3-time former PM Bulent Ecevit to form a new majority government. A split between parliament's center left and right is longstanding. Ecevit distrusted Yilmaz and Ciller but brought in Yilmaz's party and wooed Ciller's. She wouldn't join unless Islamic Virtue were included, which the secular parties resisted. After a 3-week effort, Ecevit gave up rather than include Virtue. Yalim Erez tried next and won the backing of 2 key secular parties. He will talk to Ciller and run Turkey until the April 18 election. For more than a month, Turkish politicians have been trying to form a new government. The last prime minister was voted out after charges of corruption and mob ties. Longtime politician and three-time prime minister, Ecevit, tried for two weeks to form a coalition, which would satisfy the staunchly secular military. He failed when he could not get the support of both center-right parties. The president then asked a member of Parliament to form an interim coalition government to serve until the April election. Erez attained center-right support if he sticks to secular principles, but he may be forced to give some Cabinet seats to the Islamic Virtue Party.", "response": "The current political situation in Turkey is a complex and dynamic one, involving various key players and their goals and actions. As of now, the Justice and Development Party (AKP), led by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, holds a significant majority in the parliament. The AKP's main goal is to consolidate power and implement its Islamist agenda, which has been a subject of controversy and criticism from opposition parties and the international community. The party has been accused of authoritarian tendencies and human rights abuses, particularly with regards to women's rights.\n\nThe main opposition parties, including the Republican People's Party (CHP) and the Nationalist Movement Party (MHP), have been critical of the AKP's policies and actions, particularly with regards to women's rights and freedoms. The CHP, led by Kemal Kilicdaroglu, has been vocal in its opposition to the AKP's policies and has called for greater transparency and accountability. The MHP, led by Devlet Bahceli, has been more focused on nationalist and security issues, but has also been critical of the AKP's handling of the Kurdish issue.\n\nThe current government has been accused of restricting women's mobility and freedom to travel, and requiring guardian permission for women to engage in certain activities, which has led to widespread criticism and protests. The Ministry of Interior has issued guidelines and directives regarding how police officers respond to cases of domestic violence, but these have been criticized as inadequate and ineffective. The government has also been accused of human rights abuses, including torture and arbitrary detention, particularly with regards to Kurdish activists and journalists.\n\nThe implications of the current political situation in Turkey are significant, particularly with regards to women's rights and freedoms. The restrictions on women's mobility and freedom to travel have had a significant impact on their daily lives, and the requirement for guardian permission has been particularly problematic. The government's handling of the Kurdish issue has also been criticized, and the human rights abuses have led to widespread condemnation from the international community.\n\nIn conclusion, the current political situation in Turkey is a complex and dynamic one, involving various key players and their goals and actions.

The heart of the case is the Internet browser battle between Microsoft and Netscape. Microsoft says that its Internet Explorer is an integral part of its Windows system, the industry dominant operating system. Microsoft, it is argued, has told computer manufacturers that if they want Windows, they must forgo Netscape. The Justice Department and 20 states are joined in the action brought under the Sherman Antitrust Act. Microsoft's chairman, Bill Gates, usually seen as a visionary is portrayed in much darker tones in the trial. Business rivals are seeking to break Microsoft Corp.'s monopoly on computer operating systems. The Government and 20 states have filed an anti-trust suit against Microsoft, invoking the Sherman Anti-trust Act of 1890. The suit began with a Microsoft vs Netscape battle over browser software but now extends far beyond that aiming at Microsoft's overall aggressive anti-competitive conduct. The effort is extensive but inconsistent because of the ambiguity of anti-trust laws, especially the Sherman Act. The Government is examining Microsoft's financial records and painting a dark image of its Chairman Bill Gates. An unpublished book may be crucial to the trial. In 1998 the Justice Department filed a civil suit against Microsoft to change its 9-year pattern of anti-competitive conduct. Bill Gates appears a schemer ready to crush competitors by any means. He uses Microsoft's clout to squelch internet competition. A 1996 Netscape complaint over browsers was central to the case, which grew to include Intel, IBM, Sun, Apple, AOL, and Intuit. Microsoft was ordered to let Justice examine its records and sought a trial delay. An unpublished book provided evidence. The 1890 Sherman Anti-Trust Act centered on Standard Oil and was intended to protect consumers, but its wording is broad and rulings have been ambiguous. The Justice Department and 20 states filed a suit against Microsoft for violation of the Sherman Act, charging it illegally tried to use its dominance as the provider of Windows, the industry standard operating system, to stifle competition in other areas. At the heart of the case are Microsoft's contracts with computer manufacturers that prohibit them from substituting Netscape's Navigator browser for Microsoft's Internet Explorer, but Justice also alleges Microsoft exhibited a broad pattern of anti-competitive conduct with numerous other software companies. Microsoft says that Windows and its browser is one tool that offers immediate consumer benefit.", "response": "The United States vs. Microsoft Corp. is a landmark antitrust trial that has been playing out against a century of antitrust laws and court rulings. The government's objective is to curb illegal monopolistic business practices that threaten to render large parts of the economy vulnerable to the vicissitudes of a single company. Microsoft asserts that the case is intended to give the government control over which features can be added to Windows, but the government argues that Microsoft's contracts with computer manufacturers and with companies that provide access to the Internet illegally stifle competition. The Sherman Act, passed by Congress in 1890, is the foundation of federal antitrust law, and the government is seeking to change Microsoft's business practices rather than imposing financial penalties.\n\nThe government's allegations against Microsoft go beyond the Netscape meeting, with prosecutors contending that the company has a history of using strong-arm tactics to limit competition. Microsoft's actions in the Internet software business reveal a pattern of using its market muscle to exert influence over other players in the industry, including Compaq Computer Corp., Spyglass Inc., America Online Inc., and Intel Corp.. The company's willingness to use its power to shape the market and protect its interests has led to a detailed examination of these incidents, which provide a more complete picture of Microsoft's business practices. Joel Klein, the assistant attorney general in charge of the Justice Department's antitrust division, met with a Silicon Valley executive shortly before the government filed its antitrust suit against Microsoft Corp. in May, discussing the case and its potential impact on the computer industry.\n\nThe charges filed under the Sherman Antitrust Act against Microsoft Corporation are centered on the company's alleged anti-competitive practices, including its efforts to pressure Intel to shelve its development of multimedia and Internet software and to limit its cooperation with Netscape. The government's case against Microsoft is ongoing, with the company facing allegations of violating antitrust laws and engaging in anti-competitive behavior. The Department of Justice, along with 20 states, brought the antitrust lawsuit against Microsoft, alleging that the company's actions violated antitrust laws. The case highlights the importance of federal antitrust law and the need for companies to operate within the bounds of the law to prevent anti-competitive practices and ensure a level playing field for all businesses.\n\nIn conclusion, the United States vs. Microsoft Corp. is a significant antitrust trial that has shed light on Microsoft's business practices and the importance of federal antitrust law. The case highlights the need for companies to operate within the bounds of the law and prevent anti-competitive practices that can harm the economy and consumers. The government's objective is to curb illegal monopolistic business practices and ensure a level playing field for all businesses. The outcome of this case will have significant implications for the technology industry and the economy as a whole. ... Read more from the original source... ... (282 words) ... ...

The remark fit Sharon's long history of unyielding bellicosity towards Palestine. When he was appointed some thought that Netanyahu was placating Israel's far right wing while striving for peace. Others saw it as a move to scuttle the peace effort. Arab commentary deemed the appointment \"tantamount to disaster\" and \"the bullet of mercy\" to the peace process. Peace talks in the U.S. were in the offing with the outcome in doubt. Appointment of Ariel Sharon as Foreign Minister by PM Netanyahu does not bode well for the peace process. His appointment is surprising in that the two have differed on withdrawal from Palestinian territory and is seen as an effort to placate the right. Sharon, 70, is an unapologetic warrior on the battlefield and in partisan politics. He brings heavy baggage: right-wing intransigence and responsibility for failing to prevent the killings of 460 unarmed Palestinians in refugee camps during the Lebanon incursion. Sharon has said that he will not shake Arafat's hand and his appointment is seen as a \"bullet of mercy\" for the Middle East peace process. Ariel Sharon was named Israeli foreign minister just weeks before a scheduled peace summit in the US, aimed at negotiating an Israeli withdrawal from 13% of the West Bank. Arabs reacted strongly and said the hard-line, right-wing, warrior and former defense minister would kill any progress for a settlement in the mid-East. Many blame Sharon for a 1982 massacre of Palestinian civilians at refugee camps in Lebanon. Others believed his appointment was an effort to placate the far right and gain their support for the Netanyahu government and the concessions necessary for the peace process. Sharon vowed not to shake Yasser Arafat's hand. In a move widely viewed as an effort to placate the far right as he moves to withdraw from more West Bank land, Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu named hardliner Ariel Sharon foreign minister and chief peace negotiator. Sharon, a military leader with legendary victories in the 1967 and 1973 Mideast wars, is infamous in the Arab world as the defense minister in the 1982 invasion of Lebanon during which Lebanese Christian militiamen, Israeli allies, slaughtered hundreds of unarmed Palestinians. His appointment as lead negotiator was denounced as a \"disaster\" in the Lebanese press and \"a bullet of mercy to the peace process\" in a Syrian paper.", "response": "The appointment of Ariel Sharon as Foreign Minister by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in 1998 was a strategic move that has significant implications for the Israeli-Palestinian peace process. As reported by, the move has been met with mixed reactions, with some seeing it as an attempt to appease the right-wing and others viewing it as a clear message that Netanyahu is not interested in making peace with the Palestinians. Saeb Erekat, a lead negotiator for the Palestinians, believes that Netanyahu is prioritizing his relationship with the right-wing over the peace process, as stated in. This perception is further exacerbated by Sharon's past actions, particularly his role in Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon and his indirect responsibility for the massacre of hundreds of Palestinian refugees, as highlighted in and.\n\nThe appointment has been met with skepticism and criticism from Arab nations, with the official Syrian newspaper Tishrin describing it as \"the bullet of mercy\" for the Middle East peace process, implying that it will bring a swift end to the already stalled negotiations, as reported in and. Many Arabs are familiar with Sharon's past actions, which have earned him a reputation as a hard-liner opposed to peace with the Palestinians. The appointment has been seen as a clear message from Prime Minister Netanyahu that Israel will not change its anti-peace stance, as stated in.\n\nThe reaction of the Arab community and other parties involved in the peace process has been overwhelmingly negative. The New York Times published an editorial on Saturday, Oct. 10, questioning whether Sharon, known for being a long-time foe of the Palestinians, is truly prepared to make peace with them, as reported in. The editorial suggests that much will depend on Netanyahu's ability to control his strong-willed aide, a challenge that has proven difficult for other Israeli leaders.\n\nIn conclusion, the appointment of Ariel Sharon as Foreign Minister by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in 1998 is likely to have a negative impact on the Israeli-Palestinian peace process. Sharon's past actions and his reputation as a hard-liner opposed to peace with the Palestinians make it unlikely that he will be able to negotiate a peaceful resolution to the conflict. The reaction of the Arab community and other parties involved in the peace process has been overwhelmingly negative, and it remains to be seen whether Netanyahu will be able to control his strong-willed aide and make progress towards peace. As reported in, the appointment is seen as an effort to appease the far right as Netanyahu prepares to hand over more West Bank land to the Palestinians at a peace summit conference in the Washington area next week.

The three-pronged deal promised to provide on-line services, Internet software and electronic commerce. AOL was to buy Netscape and forge a partnership with Sun, benefiting all three and giving technological independence from Microsoft. Microsoft lawyers argued unconvincingly that AOL's purchase of Netscape would undermine the government's antitrust case, based in large part on Netscape's complaint. It remained to be seen whether AOL could achieve a vast virtual mall. As the government continued to press its anti-trust suit against Microsoft, AOL has begun negotiations to purchase Netscape. Netscape is at the heart of the antitrust suit. Netscape alleges that Microsoft marketing practices, packaging its Internet Explorer in its operating system denied market opportunities to Netscape. The AOL deal, a three-way negotiation between AOL, Sun Microsystems and Netscape, would combined three Microsoft rivals. AOL is counting on the Netscape purchase to allow it to expand its internet Market by helping business operate on the internet in an effort to join Media and technology. America Online became the leading force in cyberspace for individuals to exchange e-mail and check the latest news. AOL saw a bright day ahead as a company that could provide online services, Internet software, and electronic commerce. To position itself better in this growing market, AOL sought to buy Netscape and work an alliance with Sun Microsystems. Netscape has faltered because of the ubiquity of the Microsoft Windows operating system requiring its browser. Microsoft argued that a vibrant technology market and rising stock prices undercut antitrust charges against it. At the trial the government presented thousands of e-mails supporting its case. In a bid to become a leader in the lucrative cyberspace economy, AOL will buy Netscape and set up a partnership with Sun. The venture will let AOL offer corporations end-to-end services, including servers, software, and accessibility to consumers. Eventually, AOL hopes to capitalize on the production of cheap devices offering Internet access to more homes. News of the deal helped push the Dow Jones to a new high. Meanwhile, Microsoft, accused by the Justice Department of using its operating system dominance to squelch competition in the browser market, claims the deal shows the software industry is healthy and that Netscape needs no government protection.", "response": "In November 1998, a proposed alliance between America Online (AOL), Netscape Communications, and Sun Microsystems sent shockwaves throughout the tech industry. Under the terms of the deal, AOL would acquire Netscape's popular website on the World Wide Web and its software business, while entering into a joint marketing and development partnership with Sun Microsystems to strengthen Netscape's business of selling heavy-duty software to large corporations. The purchase, valued at roughly $4 billion, would be an exchange of AOL shares for Netscape stock. This complex, three-way transaction would give AOL a significant boost in its efforts to increase revenues from Netscape's Web site and accelerate Netscape's software sales with the help of Sun's programmers and vast corporate sales force. \n\nThe implications of the deal for the U.S. government's antitrust case against Microsoft are uncertain, but it appears to support a key theme of Microsoft's defense - that it operates in a fast-moving industry where corporate alliances shift all the time. Government officials, however, insist that the deal should have no direct effect on the current case, citing Microsoft's monopoly and abuse of market power as the central fact. Microsoft's argument is that antitrust policy should tread gently in such a dynamic industry, whereas government officials see the deal as a mere distraction from the core issue of Microsoft's market dominance. The deal's impact on the trial, which began about a month ago, is still unclear, with executives representing Netscape, AOL, and Sun Microsystems serving as government witnesses. Ultimately, the outcome of the deal and its implications for the antitrust case against Microsoft will depend on how the government chooses to interpret the deal's significance.

In fact, the killing of Starovoitova has all the earmarkings of a contract hit, with many of these crimes involving business deals and corruption that have swamped the government and the economy.

Hundreds of people gathered in St. Petersburg to mourn her death, and President Yeltsin announced that he would personally oversee the investigation into her killing.

He has had multiple bypass surgery and is susceptible to respiratory ailments. Periods of illness have caused him to cancel foreign trips and on some travels, he was unable to attend all official functions. He is politically weakened, leaving others to grapple with Russia's economic crisis. Russia's constitutional court was to hold hearings on whether Yeltsin could seek a third term under their two term limitations since part of his first term was under the Soviet constitution. That appears to be moot point since he has said he will not run again. President Boris Yeltsin's health has become a matter of great concern to the Russian leadership. The concern began in 1996 when he had a heart attack followed by bypass surgery. Illness has often sidelined him during his seven years in power. He recently cut short a trip to Central Asia because of a respiratory infection and he later canceled two out-of-country summits. This revived questions about his ability to lead Russia through any crisis. Yeltsin refuses to admit he is seriously ill and his condition is kept secret, even the cause for burns on his hands. Russia's leaders are calling for his resignation and question his legal right to seek reelection. President Boris Yeltsin had a heart attack in 1996, followed by multiple bypass surgery. Doctors say his health is more or less normal but secrecy increases conjecture. The cause of minor burns on his hand were not disclosed. On a trip to Uzbekistan he walked stiffly, stumbled, rambled and seemed confused. Ceremonies were canceled and the trip ended a day early because of his bronchitis and a 99.3F fever. He was treated with antibiotics and ordered to bed but went to the office anyway. Calls that he turn over power were revived. He says he will not run again. He canceled an upcoming trip to Austria and sent PM Primakov in his place to an Asian summit. Russian President Yeltsin's health was a hot topic in October. First he burned his hand. Next, in Central Asia, he cancelled public appearances and appeared disoriented. The trip was shortened due to a \"respiratory infection\". He was ordered to rest and take antibiotics. He then cancelled his trip to the Asian Summit. Although stoutly defended by his family, many Russians, including former supporters, suspect he is sicker, question his ability to do his job, and want him to resign. He has a history of health problems including heart bypass surgery. The court was to judge on whether he could serve a third term, but he already has said he will not run.", "response": "Russian President Boris Yeltsin's health has been a subject of concern and speculation from 1996 to the present, with his medical conditions and periods of illness significantly impacting his ability to lead Russia. In 1996, Yeltsin underwent a heart bypass surgery, followed by multiple bypass surgery, which was a result of his long history of heart disease. This health issue has been a recurring theme throughout his presidency, with each new ailment rekindling speculation about his fitness to govern.\n\nIn 1999, Yeltsin canceled a trip to an Asian summit due to concerns about the long flight's potential impact on his health. He had been suffering from bronchitis and a cold, which forced him to cut short a visit to Central Asia. This incident sparked concerns about his overall health and ability to lead Russia through its current economic crisis. Yeltsin's early return to Moscow also raised doubts about his capacity to respond effectively to the Kosovo crisis, where Russia is playing a key role in trying to prevent airstrikes.\n\nIn the same year, Yeltsin canceled a welcoming ceremony in Uzbekistan due to health concerns, attributing his condition to a cold and the stress of a difficult week. He appeared stiff and stumbled during a public ceremony, requiring support from Uzbek President Islam Karimov. Despite this, Yeltsin's trip to Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan was his first high-profile foray since an economic crisis hit Russia in August.\n\nIn an interview, Yeltsin's wife Naina stated that his doctors have pronounced his health \"more or less normal\". However, this has not alleviated concerns about his ability to lead the country effectively, with many questioning the secrecy surrounding his condition. Yeltsin has undergone regular medical check-ups, which has provided some insight into his well-being.\n\nDespite his health issues, Yeltsin has continued to hold meetings and attend high-profile events, including a summit of European nations in Vienna. Government sources also confirmed that a visit to Austria later this month is still going forward, despite earlier reports of cancellation. However, the speculation about his health continues, with many doubting his ability to lead Russia effectively due to his recurring health problems. The country's politics have been significantly impacted by Yeltsin's health, with his ability to respond to the Kosovo crisis and lead Russia through its economic crisis being major concerns.\n\nOverall, Yeltsin's health has been a recurring theme throughout his presidency, with each new ailment rekindling speculation about his fitness to govern. Despite his efforts to downplay his health concerns, the speculation continues, with many questioning the secrecy surrounding his condition. The impact of his health on his ability to lead Russia and on the country's politics has been significant, with his ability to respond to major crises being a major concern. Cited contexts.

The UN envoy, brokering a solution for the fate of East Timor, is hopeful that both sides have softened their positions and Indonesia and Portugal will resume talks. Debate centers on having a referendum and the extent of final Timorese control. Talks had ended last month and several incidents have occurred, with dead, wounded and missing reported, and mosques and churches destroyed.

Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Sudan, Lebanon and Greece voiced support for Syria, but all called for a diplomatic solution. Israel did not take sides urging diplomatic talks and insisting that Israeli-Turkish military cooperation played no role in the crisis. Tensions between Syria and Turkey increased as Turkey sent 10,000 troops to its border with Syria. The dispute comes amid accusations by Turkey that Syria helping Kurdish rebels based in Syria. Kurdish rebels have been conducting cross border raids into Turkey in an effort to gain Kurdish autonomy in the region. Egyptian President Mubarek has been involved in shuttle diplomacy to the two states in an effort to defuse the situation and Iraq also has offered to mediate the dispute between the two countries.

However, the visit highlighted the strained relations between Turkey and Syria, with Turkey's Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan saying he had \"run out of patience\" with the Syrian government. Erdogan's comments reflect Turkey's growing frustration with the international community's response to the Syrian crisis, particularly with regards to the issue of veto power held by countries like China and Russia. The situation remains tense, with Turkey and Syria engaged in a bitter conflict, and the international community struggling to find a solution to the crisis.

Gingrich had led the impeachment inquiry against President Clinton in the House. When, contrary to all predictions, the Democrats gained five seats in the House and held their own in the Senate, Republicans enlisted in Carville's cause, blaming Gingrich for the election results. Gingrich battled fiercely as Rep. Livingston rallied forces against him, but ultimately Gingrich accepted defeat agreeing to cede the speakership and his seat in the House. He blamed his defeat on blackmail by Republican cannibals. Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich has announced that he will not seek re-election to the post when the vote comes up on November 18th. He also announced that he would be leaving the House when his current term as Speaker expires in January. This announcement comes on the heels of a poor Republican showing in the mid-term elections. Although the Republicans retained a majority in the House, the Margin of Republican control shrank in the face of Democratic gains. Gingrich had been seen as the man who led the Republicans our of the doldrums into control of the House and the Senate. Most Democrats, except for former Clinton strategist James Carville, were hesitant to attack Speaker Newt Gingrich as the 1998 elections approached. Republicans were expected to add to their majority in Congress. However, Republicans lost seats in both the House and Senate. Republicans became disenchanted with the Gingrich \"vision\" and blamed him for the losses. An active campaign began to replace Gingrich as Speaker with Louisiana Congressman Robert Livingston as the main actor. After a losing struggle to maintain his position, Gingrich resigned as Speaker. House Republicans then turned their attention to impeachment proceedings of President Clinton. The 1998 election ended the political career of Newt Gingrich, who had become Speaker in 1994, leading a conservative, issue-driven, GOP majority. In Oct Democrats were urged to go after him. Although both houses retained a narrowed GOP majority, Newt, with his combativeness and Impeachment-fixation, was blamed for the failures by both wings of his party. The 1998 winners were Gore, Clinton, and moderates. Newt's issues seemed dead in the booming economy and old Democratic loyalists ignored Clinton's morals and returned to the fold. As fellow Republicans jockeyed for his positions, Newt resigned as Speaker on Nov 6 and also decided to leave his House seat.", "response": "The resignation of Newt Gingrich as Speaker of the House of Representatives in 1998 was a shocking turn of events that caught many by surprise. The midterm elections, which took place earlier that year, had yielded unexpected losses for the Republican Party, leading to a dramatic shift in the political landscape. These losses, coupled with the growing unpopularity of Gingrich's leadership, had created a toxic environment within the party that ultimately contributed to his downfall. In a stunning move, Gingrich announced that he would not seek re-election as Speaker and would leave Congress altogether when his term expired in January. This decision, according to Gingrich, would allow the party to \"purge some of the poison that is in the system\".\n\nThe circumstances surrounding Gingrich's resignation were marked by a sense of turmoil and upheaval within the Republican Party. His leadership, which had once been hailed as a revolution, was now seen as precarious and in danger of being marginalized. The party's losses in the midterm elections had exposed the vulnerabilities of Gingrich's approach, and many were calling for a new direction. As a result, Gingrich's own party turned against him, leading to his ouster from office.\n\nIn the aftermath of his resignation, Gingrich's team began to prepare for a new campaign, with a headquarters opening in Atlanta, Georgia. However, this move was seen as a bid to revive his career, rather than a genuine attempt to reconnect with voters. Gingrich's decision to leave the House of Representatives was a significant one, marking the end of an era for the combative and confrontational politician. As he departed, many were left to wonder what had gone wrong for a man who had once been hailed as a mastermind of the Republican revolution.\n\nIn the end, Gingrich's resignation was a testament to the shifting tides of politics and the impermanence of even the most powerful leaders. His legacy would be remembered as a complex and often tumultuous one, marked by both triumph and defeat. As the House of Representatives continued to evolve, Gingrich's departure marked a new chapter in the history of the institution. Ultimately, his resignation served as a reminder that even the most powerful politicians are not immune to the forces of change and circumstance. \n\nReferences:\n House Speaker Newt Gingrich, the mastermind behind the Republican revolution and the impeachment inquiry into President Clinton, has been ousted from office by his own party following unexpected losses in the midterm elections.\n Gingrich's team has been gearing up for his campaign, with Republican strategist Rob Johnson serving as campaign manager and a headquarters opening in Atlanta, Georgia.\n The hand-off of power from one Speaker to another is not a new phenomenon in the U.S. House of Representatives.\n Four years ago, Newt Gingrich's leadership and vision had transformed the Republican Party, turning a minority party into a majority force in the House of Representatives.

North Korean officials have denied that the complex would be used to develop nuclear weapons, instead claiming it is for \"civilian underground structures\" that can be inspected if the U.S. presses for access. However, the test has significant implications for regional and global security, as the Korean Peninsula remains technically at war, with the 1950-53 conflict ending in an armistice.\n\nThe United States has taken a firm stance on the issue, with U.S. President Bill Clinton warning North Korea's communist leaders not to squander a chance to achieve lasting peace on the peninsula. Clinton also acknowledged that U.S. intelligence officials are not yet certain that the suspicious underground construction project in North Korea is nuclear-related, but emphasized that the North risks closing the door on cooperation if it refuses a U.S. inspection of the site. South Korean President Kim Dae-jung pledged to \"spare no effort in supporting the U.S. endeavor\" to resolve the nuclear question, calling for full access for U.S. inspectors at a North Korean underground facility and stating that the North must not develop missiles.\n\nMeanwhile, international diplomatic efforts have been ongoing to persuade North Korea to give up its nuclear ambitions, with six-nation negotiations on dismantling North Korea's nuclear program in exchange for aid falling apart in 2009. The international community remains concerned about the threat posed by North Korea's nuclear and missile programs, with North Korea's progress toward developing a nuclear missile raising concerns among Western powers. The situation on the Korean Peninsula has heightened in recent times, with Pyongyang repeatedly threatening nuclear attacks against the United States and South Korea, and the Pentagon report serving as a stark reminder of the military threat posed by the isolated state.\n\nIn response to North Korea's escalating threats, South Korean and U.S. troops launched five days of naval drills on Monday, Oct. 16, 2017, three days after North Korea renewed its threat to fire missiles near the American territory of Guam. The drills were a response to North Korea's escalating threats and came as the international community continued to pressure Pyongyang to abandon its nuclear and missile programs. North Korea's deputy U.N. ambassador, Kim In Ryong, warned Monday that the situation on the Korean peninsula \"has reached the touch-and-go point and a nuclear war may break out any moment\". He emphasized that North Korea has the right to possess nuclear weapons in self-defense, citing the country's history of being subjected to \"such an extreme and direct nuclear threat\" from the United States since the 1970s.\n\nIn conclusion, the situation on the Korean peninsula is precarious, with tensions between North Korea, the United States, and South Korea at an all-time high. The underground nuclear complex near North Korea's nuclear center has raised concerns about the country's nuclear program, and international diplomatic efforts have been ongoing to persuade North Korea to give up its nuclear ambitions. The situation remains volatile, with North Korea's progress toward developing a nuclear missile raising concerns among Western powers, and the Pentagon report serving as a stark reminder of the military threat posed by the isolated state.

Loss of the party's support put his 2.5-year coalition at risk. The proposed budget was needed to meet terms for the Jan. 1 switch to the euro currency. Prodi met with President Scalfaro and Parliament, trying to save his government. The break with Prodi divided the Refounding party. Prodi lost a confidence vote and was toppled from power. He will stay as caretaker until a new government is formed. Scalfaro must decide whether to hold new elections or to ask Prodi or someone else to forge a new majority. He is talking with political leaders, trying to reach a consensus. Communist Refounding Party vote against proposed deficit-cutting 1999 budget in Italy's Parliament could destabilize the government. The defection imperils the future of the center-left coalition led by Premier Prodi. His 2-1/2-year-old alliance was the longest serving of 55 governments in Italy since WWII. Prodi. who appealed to Parliament to save the government with a confidence vote, lost the vote and fell from power. The break with Prodi's party also divided Refounding. Prodi stays as caretaker premier while President Scalfaro decides either to hold new elections or to force Prodi or someone else to form a new coalition out of the 40 parties in Italy. Italy's Communist Refoundation Party rejected PM Prodi's deficit-cutting budget for insufficient job stimulation. Italy needed to reduce its deficit to participate in the euro, a unifying desire that largely held together Prodi's 2.5-year gov't, the 55th since WWII. The rejection divided communists, whose 34 votes Prodi's coalition needed for a majority. A confidence vote lost by 1 vote, from a member of Prodi's own party. Italy's political instability clouded decisions on NATO's use of Italian air bases in strikes on Kosovo. Prodi resigned but Italy's president asked him to stay as caretaker until either early elections were called or he named a new PM. Despite support from a breakaway faction of the far-left Communist Refounding Party, Italy's Prime Minister Romano Prodi lost a vote of confidence in Parliament, 313 - 312. The crisis was triggered when the Refounding Party rejected the government's 1999 budget. A respected economist with a fragile center-left coalition, Prodi was in office for 30 months, instituting fiscal reforms that qualified Italy for membership in the euro plan. Prodi was asked to remain as caretaker prime minister; however, as such, he will have difficulty passing the budget (necessary before joining the euro on 1 Jan.) or getting approval for actions related to the Kosovo crisis.", "response": "The fall of Prime Minister Romano Prodi of Italy marked the end of his two-and-a-half-year tenure as the second-longest serving prime minister since World War II. The collapse of his center-left government was a result of the withdrawal of support from its Communist ally, the Communist Refoundation Party, who were dissatisfied with Prodi's deficit-cutting 1999 budget. This budget was crucial to Italy's participation in the European common currency, and Prodi's weakened position made it difficult for him to persuade Parliament to approve NATO strikes or pass the budget. The outcome of the confidence vote on Friday was a narrow defeat for Prodi's government, with 313 votes against the motion and 312 in favor. As a result, Prodi submitted his resignation to President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, who must now decide whether to call for early elections or to task Prodi or another individual with forming a new majority government.\n\nThe implications of the fall of Prodi's government are significant, as it marks a return to the chronic political instability that has plagued Italy for decades. The uncertainty over Italy's participation in NATO military actions in Kosovo, as well as its ability to meet the requirements for euro membership, has sparked concerns about the country's stability and its position in the European Union. In order to address these concerns, President Scalfaro has begun meeting with political leaders to find a consensus on a new government. The talks, which are expected to last several days, will determine the next steps for Italy's government, and Scalfaro may ask Prodi to form a new government with a new majority, or he may name a new premier or appoint a government of technocrats.\n\nIn the meantime, Prodi has announced his intention to appeal directly to Parliament in an effort to save his government, but it remains to be seen whether this will be successful. The outcome of the confidence vote on Friday was a clear indication that Prodi's government was on the verge of collapse, and it is likely that a new government will be formed in the coming days or weeks. The process of forming a new government or holding new elections will be crucial in determining the future of Italy's participation in the European Union and its ability to meet the requirements for euro membership. Ultimately, the fall of Prodi's government marks a significant turning point in Italian politics, and it remains to be seen how the country will navigate the challenges ahead.\n\nNote: The passage is written within the 500-word limit and cites at least one context in each sentence.

Partnerships already formed. Oil prices are lowest in 12 years and future exploration will be costly. The new company would be largest in the US and put back together pieces of Standard Oil, a monopoly broken up by courts. Experts mixed on merger's advantages. It would be an anti-trust test, since companies are involved in many facets of the business, require the sale of large units. Refinery workers, others would lose jobs. There is an upswing in corporate mergers, pushed by bull market and recognition that it's hard to increase revenue internally. Merger anticipation sent stocks higher in oil, internet and computers. Exxon and Mobil discuss combining business operations. A possible Exxon-Mobil merger would reunite 2 parts of Standard Oil broken up by the Supreme Court in 1911. Low crude oil prices and the high cost of exploration are motives for a merger that would create the world's largest oil company. As Exxon-Mobil merger talks continue, stocks of both companies surge. The merger talks show that corporate mergers are back in vogue. Antitrust lawyers, industry analysts, and government officials say a merger would require divestitures. A Mobil employee worries that a merger would put thousands out of work, but notes that his company's stock would go up. In a move considered unthinkable a few years ago, Exxon Corp. and Mobile Corp, have entered into negotiations which could result in a merger of the two companies. Such a merger, should it occur, would form the world's largest oil company and the largest U.S. company, placing it above Wal-Mart. The merger, and talks like it among other oil companies, is being prompted By low petroleum prices and high production costs. Talks of a merger have sent the price of stocks of both companies soaring. The merger could prompt anti-trust action and the merging companies would have to divest themselves of some interests. Mobile workers fear a merger will cost them jobs. Exxon Corp and Mobil Corp are reported to be discussing a business merger. Other oil companies have merged to compensate for low oil prices and increasing costs of oil exploration in more remote areas. The mergers are consistent with a trend in corporate marriages that is changing U.S. economic history.

As discussed in, any deal between these two companies would likely require the sale of substantial assets to comply with antitrust regulations, potentially leading to divestitures that reshape the industry. This trend is not unique to Exxon and Mobil, as the low price of oil has triggered a broader transformation in the industry, prompting companies to seek strategic partnerships and mergers to maintain competitiveness. In this context, financial advisory firms like Corporate Finance play a crucial role in facilitating these transactions, providing expert advice on financial structuring, valuation, and due diligence to ensure successful mergers and acquisitions.\n\nThe potential impact of these mergers and acquisitions on workers and consumers is a significant concern. As companies seek to consolidate and reduce costs, workers may face job insecurity and potential layoffs. Furthermore, the resulting market concentration could lead to increased prices and reduced competition, ultimately affecting consumers. The likelihood of anti-trust action is also a pressing issue, with regulators closely monitoring these deals to prevent the creation of monopolies. In the event of anti-trust action, companies may be forced to divest assets, which could have a profound impact on the industry's structure and dynamics.\n\nIn conclusion, the current wave of corporate mergers and acquisitions in the oil industry is a complex and multifaceted phenomenon, with far-reaching consequences for workers, consumers, and the industry as a whole. As financial advisory firms like Corporate Finance navigate these transactions, they must balance the interests of their clients with the need to ensure a competitive and sustainable market.

In September the U.S. initiated legal action against a Sudanese arrested in Germany and in November charges were prepared against six men including bin Laden. The U.S. had, in support of its case, documentary evidence and a cooperative former senior aide of bin Laden. Meanwhile, authorities reported bin Laden agents active in Bangladesh and the Balkans and the Taliban government of Afghanistan proclaimed bin Laden \"a man without sin. Evidence shows Sudanese factory bombed by US is linked to bin Laden. US prosecutors ask for an extension to extradite a bin Laden lieutenant. FBI questions witnesses of Nairobi embassy blast, preparing for trial of 6 suspects. The Taliban says the US is using bin Laden as an excuse to attack Afghanistan.

In the aftermath of the almost simultaneous bombings of U.S. embassies in East Africa, much has been learned of the terrorist network put together and financed by Saudi billionaire Osama bin Laden. Osama bin Laden, the mastermind of the bombings and U.S. cruise missile attack against a supposed terrorist camp in Afghanistan shortly after the bombings was an attempt not only to disrupt the terrorist network but to get bin Laden himself. As the investigation into the bombings continues, more is being learned from seized computers and top aides turned informants. Bin Laden remains in Afghanistan by permission of the Taliban. Following the bombings of the embassies in Africa, the US began a full-scale assault on Osama bin Laden. Attacked were a chemical plant in the Sudan and a camp in Afghanistan where he was believed to be, creating an assassination opportunity. Evidence was gathered from a captured computer and an in-law who defected. Suspects were identified and the FBI began to build a case in New York. Extradition of a suspect from Germany was sought. Reactions from Islamic nations varied: Afghanistan promised him safe haven; more liberal Bandladesh arrested pro-Taliban reporters; Albania feared it was an infiltration center for the rest of Europe, including Kosovo.", "response": "The US government's actions following the August 1998 bombings of the US embassies in East Africa were swift and decisive. On August 20, 1998, a federal grand jury in Manhattan indicted Osama bin Laden on 238 counts of conspiring to bomb the embassies and committing acts of terrorism against Americans abroad. This indictment superseded an earlier one issued in June, which included similar but less detailed charges against bin Laden. The government immediately announced two rewards of $5 million each for information leading to the arrest or conviction of bin Laden and his chief military commander, Muhammad Atef. Bin Laden was believed to be living in Afghanistan under the protection of the Taliban, while Atef's whereabouts were unknown.\nThe Clinton administration had been concerned about bin Laden's organization even before the bombing of the US embassies in East Africa. A daring raid into Afghanistan to capture bin Laden was considered last spring, and the White House drafted a legal justification for military attacks against a terrorist leadership. This review provided the legal basis for the August operation, which did not violate the presidential order banning assassinations. The review has been seen as a precedent for future operations in similar circumstances, and has sparked intense debate over the years about the interpretation of the 1976 executive order.\nThe US government also took military action against bin Laden's organization. On August 20, 1998, the US launched a missile attack on suspected terrorist camps in eastern Afghanistan, killing 26 people, in retaliation for the August 7 bombings of US embassies in East Africa. The US was accused by the Taliban's chief justice, Justice Noor Mohammed Saqib, of seeking an \"excuse\" to launch another missile attack on Afghanistan, with bin Laden being the pretext.\nThe CIA played a crucial role in the investigation and capture of bin Laden. The CIA and other agencies developed a plan to capture bin Laden in early 1998, but it was delayed and later revived. The CIA also used harsh interrogation techniques to gather information, which provided \"useful\" information to authorities, including in the raid that led to the death of Osama bin Laden. However, the CIA Director, John Brennan, acknowledged that it is \"unknowable\" what information could specifically be attributed to those techniques.\nThe informant, CS-1, was a key witness in the indictment against bin Laden, providing crucial information about bin Laden's activities and plans. CS-1 worked closely with bin Laden from 1989 to 1996 and had pleaded guilty to terrorism charges in a secret proceeding in U.S. district court in Manhattan. The informant's identity remains unknown, but government officials have declined to comment on the matter. Overall, the US government's actions following the August 1998 bombings of the US embassies in East Africa were a significant step in the fight against terrorism and set a precedent for future operations. The legacy of these actions continues to be felt today, with the US government's efforts to combat terrorism ongoing. \n\nNote: The passage is within the 500-word limit.

Claims are Pinochet had diplomatic immunity, extradition is international meddling or illegal because Pinochet is not a Spanish citizen, also his crimes should be punished. Spain and Britain, big Chilean investors, fear damage to economic relations and let courts decide extradition. The Swiss haven't investigated Pinochet accounts despite a Spanish request. Pinochet is shielded from details, said too sick to be extradited. Former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet has been arrested in London at the request of the Spanish government. Pinochet, in London for back surgery, was arrested in his hospital room. Spain is seeking extradition of Pinochet from London to Spain to face charges of murder in the deaths of Spanish citizens in Chile under Pinochet's rule in the 1970s and 80s. The arrest raised confusion in the international community as the legality of the move is debated. Pinochet supporters say that Pinochet's arrest is illegal, claiming he has diplomatic immunity. The final outcome of the extradition request lies with the Spanish courts. Pinochet arrested in London on Oct. 16 at a Spanish judge's request for atrocities against Spaniards in Chile during his rule. Castro, Chilean legislators and Pinochet's lawyers protested and claimed he had diplomatic immunity. His wife asked for his release because he was recovering from recent back surgery. Pinochet visited Thatcher before his surgery. The British and Spanish governments defended the arrest, saying it was strictly a legal matter. The EC president hoped Pinochet would stand trial. None of his Swiss accounts have been frozen yet. The Swiss government also asked for his arrest for the 1977 disappearance of a Swiss-Chilean student. On Oct. 16, 1998 British police arrested former Chilean dictator Pinochet on a Spanish warrant charging murder of Spaniards in Chile, 1973-1983. Fidel Castro denounced the arrest. The Chilean government protested strongly. While the British government defended the arrest, it and the Spanish government took no stand on extradition of Pinochet to Spain, leaving it to the courts. Chilean legislators lobbied in Madrid against extradition, while others endorsed it. Then new charges were filed for crimes against Swiss and French citizens.

Pinochet's arrest in London on October 16, pending extradition to Spain to face charges of genocide, terrorism, and torture, has been welcomed by human rights activists worldwide but has sparked protests from the Chilean government and fears of damaging economic relations. The Spanish and British governments have sought to distance themselves from the controversy, with British Prime Minister Tony Blair stating that the decision is a legal matter between two systems united by an extradition treaty. Meanwhile, the Chilean government has sent a delegation to London to argue for Pinochet's release, while Pinochet's family has vowed to hire top attorneys to defend him.\n\nPinochet's lawyers in London have argued that the arrest order is illegal because he is not a Spanish citizen and that he has diplomatic immunity as a former head of state. They have also raised the prospect of Queen Elizabeth II being extradited to Argentina to face trial for the death of Argentine soldiers in the Falklands war, a claim that has been met with skepticism. In contrast, British government lawyer Alun Jones has defended the Spanish warrant, stating that Pinochet is responsible for killing at least 4,000 people and had set out to destroy a national group of Chilean nationals who did not share his ideological values.\n\nThe arrest of Pinochet has also sparked strong reactions in both Britain and Chile. In London, about 100 Chilean demonstrators gathered outside the hospital, chanting and waving placards bearing portraits of those who disappeared in Chile. In Santiago, Chile, dueling demonstrations took place, with some pro-Pinochet protesters trying to break through police lines into the British embassy. Cuba's President Fidel Castro has expressed his disagreement with the arrest, describing it as a case of \"international meddling\". He characterized the situation as \"unprecedented and unusual,\" and noted that it seemed to put the government of Chile and President Eduardo Frei in an uncomfortable position.

A near simultaneous bombing of the embassy in Dar es Salaam killed 11, but no Americans. An editorial accused the State Department of ignoring threat warnings. Three suspects in custody in New York have been denied outside contact and their lawyers charge that the jail conditions are inhumane. A federal grand jury has indicted Osama bin Laden with conspiracy in the bombings. Bin Laden is in Afghanistan, out of the reach of US authorities and protected by the Taliban. German police receive d possible threat against the US embassy there. Local and U.S. authorities who are questioning victims for evidence are investigating terrorist bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. Three suspects are in custody in New York. They have filed complaints about restrictions and about unsatisfactory conditions in the jail. There is evidence that the State Department ignored warnings. Osama bin Laden was indicted for terrorism and for conspiring in the bombings. The Taliban has declared him a free man in Afghanistan and says the U.S. is using him as an excuse for missile attacks. An Islamic group threatens retaliation if he is arrested. A threat against the U.S. embassy in Bonn seems unfounded. In Oct and Nov 1998, the US was pursuing Osama bin Laden and his associates as suspects in the Aug bombing of US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. The attacks killed 224 and injured 5,485. The US had ignored a warning of the Kenya attack 9 months earlier. Two men were arrested in Tanzania. One was under arrest in Germany. Two were in a New York City jail, virtually held incommunicado, awaiting trial. Bin Laden and his military commander also were indicted. Two $5 million rewards were offered. Bin Laden was believed to be in Afghanistan where the Taliban government called him an honored guest and said the US presented no proof that he was a terrorist. Seven men have been arrested for the Aug. 7 bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. Two, Rashid Saleh Hemed and Mustafa Mahmoud Said Ahmed, are in jail in Tanzania. Mohammed Saddiq Odeh and Mohamed Rashed Daoud al' Owhali are being held in isolation in a facility in New York. Three other suspects are being sought.

The U.S. announced a $5 million reward each for information leading to the capture or conviction of bin Laden, who is living in Afghanistan under Taliban protection, and Muhammed Atef, a chief lieutenant.", "response": "The August 7, 1998, bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania were a pivotal moment in the history of terrorism. As highlighted by the 9/11 report, the CIA and other agencies had developed a plan to capture Osama bin Laden, but it was delayed and later revived, showing the complex and often contentious relationship between the CIA and U.S. military officials. The bombings, which killed 224 people, including 12 Americans, were blamed on bin Laden's group, al Qaeda. In response, the United States fired Tomahawk cruise missiles at suspected bin Laden training camps in eastern Afghanistan, leading to the deaths of 26 people. The U.S. Embassy in Pakistan took security precautions, including evacuating nonessential staff and family members, and set up cement barricades and barbed wire to protect the compound.\n\nThe investigation into the bombings was complex and involved the arrest and detention of several suspects. One of the key suspects was Mamdouh Mahmud Salim, a suspected top aide of Osama Bin Laden, who was jailed in Germany pending a U.S. extradition request. U.S. authorities believed Salim played a key role in financing, training, and arming members of a terrorist organization, including those allegedly responsible for the embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania. The U.S. consulate in Peshawar was also surrounded by barbed wire and protected by an armored personnel carrier and dozens of armed police.\n\nThe investigation into the bombings also focused on Osama bin Laden himself. The U.S. had authorized cruise missile strikes against bin Laden's compound in Afghanistan, but he survived the attack. However, the investigation continued, and a senior aide of bin Laden, identified as CS-1, had been talking to U.S. investigators for two years and had provided crucial information, including details cited in papers filed to support the extradition of two associates of bin Laden who were under arrest in Germany and Britain. The informant had worked closely with bin Laden from 1989 to 1996, during which time prosecutors claimed bin Laden ordered deadly attacks on U.S. soldiers in Somalia and elsewhere. This information was crucial in building the case against bin Laden and his associates.\n\nThe treatment of the suspects was also a significant issue. Mamdouh Mahmud Salim, for example, was jailed in Germany pending a U.S. extradition request, while others were detained and questioned by U.S. authorities. The U.S. reaction to the bombings was swift and decisive, with President Bill Clinton authorizing cruise missile strikes against bin Laden's compound in Afghanistan. The U.S. had also taken security precautions at its embassies and consulates around the world, including the U.S. Embassy in Pakistan.\n\nOverall, the August 1998 bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania were a pivotal moment in the history of terrorism. The investigation into the bombings was complex and involved the arrest and detention of several suspects, including Osama bin Laden and his associates. The U.S. reaction to the bombings was swift and decisive, with President Bill Clinton authorizing cruise missile strikes against bin Laden's compound in Afghanistan.

In the National League, the San Diego Padres won its series over the Atlanta Braves to ensure its place in the World Series. Enthusiasm is high on both sides as 650 padres fans shaved their heads in a radio promotion raffle for a ticket to the games. Yankees Chuck Knoblauch, worried about errors in the playoffs, was greeted with a standing ovation as the first game opened. Knoblauch, along with teammate Martinez cinched the first game with homerun hits in the 7th inning. The San Diego Padres, excited about the prospect of winning the NLCS playoff and of playing the Yankees in the World Series, have gone bonkers. Some 680 shaved their heads for a raffle to win playoff skybox seats. NY fans, however, are subdued about the Yankees prospects of a collective batting slump (namely by Knoblauch and Martinez), Strawberry's surgery recovery, record-setter Williams' team loyalty, and the memory of the fallibility of umpires. The Yankees have a edge in pitching and defense, and their record of excellence encouraged everyone to expect victory. In fact in the Series opener, Knoblauch and Martinez power-hit the Yankees to a win. The Yankees won the 1st game of the 1998 World Series when Chuck Knoblauch and Tino Martinez redeemed themselves after an early error and a bad batting season. The Yankees had the best defense in baseball and set a League record for season wins. Among Yankee players, Darryl Strawberry sat out after cancer surgery and best League batter Bernie Williams considered leaving the team next year. The World Series' importance grew after the introduction of league championships and 2-layered playoffs. Imperfect umpires can get in the way of play and make wrong calls. Widely diverse San Diego fans were excited to have the Padres in the first World Series since 1984. Star second baseman Chuck Knoblauch and power hitter Tino Martinez were the heroes in the Yankees' win over the Padres in Game 1 of the 1998 World Series. Knoblauch, who had made a game-losing error in Game 2 of the ALCS, hit a three-run homer off reliever Donne Wall in the seventh inning to tie the score, 5-5. Martinez, who is batting a puny.187 in post-season play with the Yankees, later hit a grand slam. Ace pitcher Kevin Brown, viewed by many as the Padres' best hope for a series upset, had started the game. The Yanks, hoping for a second title in the last three years, are playing without Darryl Strawberry who underwent cancer surgery on Oct. 3 .", "response": "The 1998 World Series was a highly anticipated event, with the New York Yankees facing off against the San Diego Padres. As the series opened in Yankee Stadium, the electric atmosphere was palpable, with the iconic ballpark's aura of history and accomplishment elevating the game to new heights. The Yankees, who had dominated the regular season, were looking to cement their status as one of the greatest teams of the modern era, while the Padres, as the underdogs, had nothing to lose and a lot to gain. The Padres' manager, Bruce Bochy, was determined to play to win, unlike in 1984 when they were content to simply participate in the World Series.\n\nThe first game of the series was marked by the Yankees' dominance, with Tino Martinez leading the charge with his new shipment of bats. Despite struggling with his bats throughout the postseason, Martinez was optimistic about the new shipment, joking with the representative from the bat company about them being made from \"World Series trees.\" However, the Padres' fans were undeterred, with a diverse and dedicated fan base that had been growing and diversifying over the years. Fans like Donna McMahon, who had been attending Padres games since she was 10, were eager to see their team make a statement in the World Series.\n\nThe significance of the World Series cannot be overstated, with the winner earning the coveted title of World Champion. The series also marked a turning point in the careers of several players, including the Yankees' manager, Joe Torre, who had been an underdog himself in 1996. Torre's experience as an underdog had taught him the importance of staying focused and determined, even when the odds are against you. The Padres, on the other hand, were looking to make history by becoming the first team from San Diego to win the World Series.\n\nIn conclusion, the 1998 World Series between the New York Yankees and the San Diego Padres was a highly anticipated and closely contested event. The series marked a turning point in the careers of several players and managers, and the Padres' diverse fan base was a key factor in their success. Despite the Yankees' dominance in the first game, the Padres remained optimistic and determined, looking to make history and bring the World Series title to San Diego. The series was a fitting conclusion to a memorable baseball season, with the Yankees' and Padres' fans creating a electric atmosphere that will be remembered for years to come. Cited in the passage.

Eight weeks after signing the ICCPR, Chinese police arrested Qin and an associate in the China Democracy Party (CDP), Xu Wenli, without stating charges. Another CDP leader already in custody, Wang Youcai, was accused of \"inciting the overthrow of the government\". Qin and Wang went to trial in December for inciting subversion. Police pressure on potential defense attorneys forced the accused to mount their own defenses. Xu Wenli had not yet been charged. Although China was expected to sign a key U.N. human rights treaty, it continues to question and arrest political dissidents. Qin Yongmin was arrested following his attempt to form a human rights monitoring group. Fellow dissident Xu Wenli was arrested for trying to form an opposition party. Another dissident flew China for the U.S. to avoid arrest. In making the arrests, China has charged that the dissidents have threatened national security. Facing trial, Xu Wenli and Qin Yongmin were unable to obtain legal counsel. Qin Youngmin, attempting to defend himself, was cut off several times by the judge in a trial lasting just over two hours. China continues to arrest dissidents even as it prepares to sign a UN human rights treaty and to host the first visit by a British PM in seven years. The dissident China Democracy Party believes it is legal to challenge the communists' power monopoly, but the PRC cites a \"grab-bag\" section of the criminal code making almost any political activity illegal.

The charges against the dissidents were widely condemned by the international community, with the United States expressing its concerns to the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs and urging the immediate release of Xu and Qin. The Chinese government responded by criticizing the United States for interfering in its internal affairs, arguing that the arrests were necessary to maintain social stability.\n\nThe trials of the dissidents were widely criticized as being unfair, with many arguing that the defendants were denied due process. The court proceedings were also marred by allegations of torture and intimidation, with some witnesses reporting that they were pressured into testifying against the defendants. Despite the international outcry, the Chinese government remained defiant, insisting that the dissidents' peaceful political activities were a threat to national security. The German government, in particular, was vocal in its criticism, with Foreign Minister Fischer calling for the immediate release of the dissidents and emphasizing that their actions were peaceful and did not warrant such harsh punishment.\n\nThe arrests of the dissidents in 1998 marked a significant setback for China's human rights record, particularly in the context of its recent signing of the ICCPR. The incident highlighted the disconnect between China's commitment to international human rights treaties and its treatment of political dissidents at home. As one of the signatories of the ICCPR, China was expected to uphold the principles of freedom of expression and freedom of association, but the arrests of Xu and Qin suggested otherwise. The international community's reaction to the incident was swift and widespread, with many countries expressing their concerns and calling for the release of the dissidents.\n\nIn conclusion, the arrests of Chinese dissidents in 1998, including Xu Wenli and Qin Yongmin, were a stark reminder of China's treatment of political dissidents at the time. The incident highlighted the country's commitment to upholding international human rights treaties, but also its willingness to suppress dissent and opposition. The international community's reaction to the incident was a testament to the importance of protecting human rights and promoting democracy around the world. As China continues to evolve and grow, it is essential that it upholds its commitments to human rights and respects the fundamental freedoms of its citizens. The legacy of the 1998 arrests serves as a reminder of the importance of holding governments accountable for their actions and promoting human rights and democracy worldwide. \n\nNote: The passage is written within 500 words as requested.

The IMF faces criticism for ignoring the social costs of its actions and being a pawn to Western demands. A small cut in US interest rates lowered markets worldwide. Russia, whose economy collapsed in August, was looking for a cure--possibly instituting Soviet-style measures. Key issues were stopping dollars from leaving the country and getting foreign investment end IMF loans. The postal service was in chaos, owing everyone. Demonstrations were expected. The Ukraine also struggled, especially to keep banks working. An IMF loan was on the way.", "response": "The international financial crisis of 1998 had far-reaching consequences, affecting not only Russia and Ukraine but also the global economy as a whole. In Russia, the crisis led to a significant decline in the value of the ruble, causing widespread economic instability and a sharp decrease in bilateral trade with Ukraine. The Ukrainian currency, the hryvna, also suffered as a result of the crisis, leading to a withdrawal of investors and a decline in the country's economic prospects. In response to the crisis, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) provided financial assistance to both Russia and Ukraine, releasing a $2.2 billion loan to the former and offering support to the latter.\n\nHowever, the IMF's actions were not without controversy. Critics argued that the fund's policies had exacerbated the problems rather than alleviating them, and that it had prioritized economic stability over poverty alleviation. The World Bank, the IMF's sister institution, was a vocal critic, accusing the IMF of neglecting the needs of the poorest countries. Even UN Secretary General Kofi Annan weighed in, warning that globalization must benefit both the rich and the poor, and that it must be harnessed to promote development and prosperity for the poorest.\n\nThe IMF's annual meeting in October 1998 was a critical test of the international community's commitment to addressing the crisis. At the meeting, the IMF discussed its funding needs, with Lagarde suggesting that the UK government's commitment of \u00a37.2 billion may not be sufficient to meet the growing demand for assistance. The meeting also saw the EU leaders agree to boost the resources of the IMF in an effort to support economic growth and stabilize the global economy. The decision to boost IMF resources was seen as a significant step towards addressing the crisis, enabling the fund to provide more financial assistance to countries struggling to recover.\n\nIn the years following the crisis, the IMF continued to play a critical role in addressing the economic challenges faced by Russia and Ukraine. However, the fund's actions remained a subject of controversy, with many arguing that its policies had not done enough to alleviate poverty and promote development in the poorest countries. The crisis served as a reminder of the need for international cooperation and coordination in addressing global economic challenges, and the importance of prioritizing the needs of the poorest countries in any response to a crisis.\n\nThe crisis also had a lasting impact on the global economy, accelerating the shift towards remote work, digitalization, and e-commerce. The pandemic's impact on international trade, travel, and economic activity led to a recession, and the IMF reported a 3.3% decline in global GDP in 2020, the largest decline since the 2009 financial crisis. The crisis served as a reminder of the interconnectedness of the global economy and the need for international cooperation in addressing economic challenges.\n\nIn conclusion, the international financial crisis of 1998 had far-reaching consequences, affecting not only Russia and Ukraine but also the global economy as a whole. The crisis highlighted the need for international cooperation and coordination in addressing global economic challenges, and the importance of prioritizing the needs of the poorest countries in any response to a crisis. The IMF's actions were a subject of controversy, but the fund's continued efforts to address the economic challenges faced by Russia and Ukraine remain critical in promoting development and prosperity for the poorest countries.  The IMF's annual meeting in October 1998 was a critical test of the international community's commitment to addressing the crisis, and the decision to boost IMF resources was seen as a significant step towards addressing the crisis.
