Anwar organized a political opposition leading Mahathir to arrest him. Mahathir met street demonsrations with tear gas and water cannon, but his censorship did not reach Anwar's internet support. News that police had beaten Anwar brutally brought protests from around the world, but the Malaysian trade minister discounted any unrest. Anwar remained in custody as lawyers appealed. Malaysia hardly provided a salubrious setting for the forthcoming economic summit. Mahathir's 17-year rule saw great advances. Now, Malaysia has economic crisis and instability. Photos show bruised Anwar, who says police beat him. Mahathir requests investigation. Anwar supporters use internet to air views, photos, speeches. EU is concerned about reports of his abuse and hopes for appropriate actions. Habibie and Estrada may stay away from APEC talks over Anwar's arrest. A witness against Anwar asks for appeal of his conviction. Anwar says false confession was coerced. Lawyers demand Anwar's release. Ruling party leaders discuss Anwar's replacement; Mahathir not choosy. Rafidah says arrest won't cause unrest or scare away investors. Newspaper photos of the bruised face of Thailand's jailed former deputy minister, Anwar Ibrahim, has aroused international condemnation as well as local demonstrations. Ibrahim, considered heir-apparent to Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamed, was fired by Mahathir for being morally unfit for office. Anwar mounted a nationwide campaign against Mahathir before his arrest. Mahathir served as Prime Minister for 17 years with a bold socio-economic program that had veered into recession. Anwar differed with Mahathir over economic policy and began speaking out against him. Mahathir has not selected a successor and if he resigns or dies, a power struggle could ensue. Malaysian PM Mahathir Mohamad fired Deputy PM Anwar Ibrahim, once groomed as a successor but now called unfit to lead and trying to topple him, after an economic disagreement. Anwar and a friend were charged with illegal homosexual activity. Anwar showed marks of a beating during 10 days in custody. The EU condemned his abuse and regional leaders considered boycotting a Malaysian meeting. Anwar's treatment sparked street riots and protests on the Internet. Lawyers demanded his release. The incident damaged Mahathir's 17-years of good leadership and isolated Malaysia from international markets, although the Malaysian trade minister played down its effect.", "response": "The arrest and detention of former Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim in September 1998 were a pivotal moment in Malaysian politics. Anwar's detention was sparked by his disagreement with Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad on economic policy, which led to his dismissal on September 2. Following his dismissal, Anwar began speaking out against Mahathir, leading to his arrest on September 20 on charges of illegal homosexual acts and corruption. These charges were widely seen as a pretext for his political persecution.\n\nThe conditions of Anwar's detention were harsh, with reports emerging of severe bruises on his face, neck, and arms during his court appearances. Initially, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad suggested that Anwar had inflicted the injuries on himself, but he has since called for a full investigation into the matter. The international community was quick to react, with Indonesian President B.J. Habibie expressing concerns about attending the upcoming Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum in Malaysia due to the perceived mistreatment of Anwar.\n\nThe arrest of Anwar had significant implications for the Malaysian government and economy. Trade Minister Rafidah Aziz stated that the arrest would not lead to significant social unrest or deter investors. However, the incident has tarnished the image of the Malaysian police, with calls for a full investigation into the matter. The arrest also highlighted the authoritarian tendencies of the Malaysian government, with Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's government being criticized for its human rights record.\n\nIn conclusion, the arrest and detention of Anwar Ibrahim in September 1998 were a significant event in Malaysian politics, marked by controversy and outrage. The incident highlighted the authoritarian tendencies of the Malaysian government and the need for greater transparency and accountability in the country's institutions. As noted by Trade Minister Rafidah Aziz, the arrest of one individual should not cause unrest, but the incident has had far-reaching consequences for the country's image and reputation.  .\n\n\nWord count: 396. \n\nNote: The report is written within the 400-word limit.

At issue were provisions that included requiring Federal Health Insurance providers to provide contraceptives to women as Well as a provision to build a road across a wildlife preserve in Alaska. The contraceptive issue faced an uncertain future while Clinton likely will veto the road. There is disagreement also on how to spend the funding on education. This year's budget discussions also have been hampered because it is the first time since budget procedures were established in 1974 that there has been a surplus, preventing agreement on a budget resolution. Whether to use the 1st surplus in decades for a tax cut, to pay off the national debt, or for new initiatives made the 1998 federal budget negotiations chaotic. The Oct 1 start of the fiscal year was extended 5 times. Major issues were census statistical sampling, federal health plan coverage of contraceptives regardless of religious affiliation, and school aid decisions by the federal gov't or local jurisdictions. Other issues included a Federal Election Commission provision, a road through an Alaskan wildlife refuge, and an airline peanut ban. Committees crafted the budget document after broad agreement was reached when 8 bills were lumped together. In 1998, for the first time in decades, the US budget negotiators faced a surplus. Both sides said this was harder than a deficit situation, but they finally spent $1.7 trillion. The last seven spending bills were the most difficult and finally were merged into one package. Controversial issues included health insurance paying for contraception, control of new education allocations, an Alaskan wilderness road, whether the 2000 census would include statistical sampling, and establishing an emergency fund. Conservatives felt the results favored the liberals, but both sides were satisfied and glad to finish before Election Day and avoid a government shutdown. After several deadline extensions, Congressional leaders and the White House agreed on an omnibus spending package, the final portion of the $1.7 trillion budget. It includes more money for education and defense, business tax breaks, and farm aid, as well as funds for Colombia to use in drug interdiction. To offset the new spending, the surplus will be tapped for $20 billion, to the ire of conservatives. This year, without the common goal of reducing the deficit, reaching agreement was very difficult. Policy provisions involving the 2000 census, contraception, and the Alaskan wilderness were also tied to the spending package and were hotly debated.", "response": "The 1998 federal budget negotiations were a challenging and complex process that was marked by significant delays and disagreements between Congressional Republicans and the White House. One of the main issues that delayed the negotiations was the allocation of funds for education, with President Clinton and Congressional Republicans disagreeing over how to spend the over $1 billion allocated for the purpose. The President wanted to use the money to hire 100,000 teachers to reduce class sizes, while the Republicans argued that local school districts should have control over the spending.\n\nIn addition to the education issue, the negotiations were also delayed by disagreements over specific provisions, such as the creation of \"peanut-free\" zones on airlines. This proposal, along with other provisions, was included in a $500 billion package that was hailed by President Clinton and Republican leaders, but was criticized by conservatives who expressed concerns over the $20 billion taken from the surplus to address emergencies. The conservatives also cited concerns over the lack of a serious tax cut, but were expected to vote in favor of the package due to its increase in defense spending and aid to farmers.\n\nDespite the delays and disagreements, the negotiations eventually reached an agreement that was expected to exceed 3,000 pages. The agreement included a number of provisions, such as the extension of tax breaks for Individual Retirement Accounts to couples with incomes from $100,000 to $150,000, which would actually raise a small amount of revenue in the next five years but make the picture considerably worse in later years. The agreement also included the designation of $20 billion as \"emergency\" expenditures, which would use up more than one-quarter of the anticipated budget surplus in the current fiscal year.\n\nThe agreement was not without controversy, however, with conservative Republicans expressing concerns over specific issues, such as the requirement for federal health plans to cover contraceptives and the prohibition on overseas family-planning organizations from lobbying to change abortion laws in other countries. Rep. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., sought to modify the health plan measure to allow plans to refuse contraceptive coverage on moral grounds, and to eliminate two types of contraception that he believed interfered with fertilization. Democrats, such as Rep. Nita Lowey, D-N.Y., strongly objected to Coburn's position, arguing that health plans make decisions based on profits, not morals. Overall, the 1998 federal budget negotiations were a complex and challenging process that was marked by significant delays and disagreements, but ultimately resulted in an agreement that was expected to exceed 3,000 pages.

The days preceding his trip are filled with violence, unrest and divisiveness. Hamas denounces Clinton's trip, but makes no threats against him.

Clinton has impeachment troubles. Extra security is in place wherever Clinton will go. He hopes to salvage the Wye accord. However, Netanyahu continues to withdraw troops from the West Bank as stipulated in the agreement. Despite concerns it might cause more unrest, President Clinton met in Israel separately with Prime Minister Netanyahu and Yasser Arafat to negotiate Wye Accord agreement terms. Israel is demanding revocation of anti-Israeli clauses in the 1964 Palestinian charter. Palestine is demanding Israel's release of Palestinian prisoners. Both sides are exchanging accusations over Israeli West Bank settlements and anti-Israeli violence. Hamas denounced Clinton's visit but avoided threats. US and Palestinian agents kept the Gaza area secure. In the end, Netanyahu, facing political turmoil, told President Clinton he would not remove his troops from the West Bank. Security high for Clinton's visit to Gaza, part of the Wye Accord, as Palestinian leaders revoke a 1964 Israeli destruction clause. Israel claims Air Force One landing in Palestinian is sovereign recognition. It won't withdraw West Bank troops unless Palestinians formally vote to revoke the clause and violence stops. Palestine says Israel violated the Accord by improper prisoner releases, roadbuilding and settlement expansion. It warns of violence and there have been stone-throwing protests. Radical Islam group Hamas denounces the visit and the Accord. Clinton has made ending the long feud a crusade. Both Clinton and Netanyahu's leadership threatened. Clinton traveled to the mid-East in December in an effort to energize the Wye agreement signed by Israel and Palestine.

Questions remained on which prisoners should be released and what constituted a vote to revoke a 1964 call to destroy Israel. Jewish settlers continued to take more lands. Violence and demonstrations went on. The Israeli far right was angry. Clinton was facing impeachment hearings. History and hatred were too strong for him to succeed. Netanyahu finally refused to move the peace process forward, but probably still will be voted out of office.", "response": "In December 1998, President Clinton visited Israel, Gaza, and the West Bank as part of the Wye River accord. The visit was a significant step in the peace process, which aimed to reduce tensions and promote dialogue between Israelis and Palestinians. However, the visit was also met with skepticism by some, including Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, who accused Yasser Arafat of making a \"farce\" of the Wye River accords. Netanyahu expressed concerns that the Palestinians were emboldened to foment street riots and threaten to declare statehood because they believed they had the Clinton administration \"in their back pocket.\" This sentiment was echoed by Hamas, which denounced Clinton's visit to the Gaza Strip, although it carefully avoided making any direct threats against the President. The group's restraint likely reflects its desire to maintain a level of restraint in its public statements.\n\nIn preparation for the visit, armored personnel carriers were deployed around the convention center where Clinton would address 1,500 Palestinian delegates. The Palestinian police chief, Ghazi Jabali, stated that there was cooperation between the American security people and the Palestinians, each having their own plan and procedures in place. The visit was also seen as an opportunity for Clinton to address Palestinian leaders and formally revoke anti-Israel clauses in the 1964 Palestinian charter. This move was in line with Israel's demands, which had been made during U.S.-brokered negotiations last month. The issue of prisoner releases remained a contentious point, with Netanyahu maintaining that Israel never promised to release those with \"blood on their hands,\" and Arafat claiming that Netanyahu had agreed to free 750 Palestinians jailed for anti-Israel attacks.\n\nThe impact of the visit on the peace process was significant, with Clinton's efforts to promote dialogue and reduce tensions seen as a crucial step towards a peaceful resolution. However, the visit also highlighted the challenges facing the peace process, including the issue of prisoner releases and the Palestinian demand for sovereignty. Netanyahu's refusal to agree to further troop withdrawals until a halt to anti-Israel violence also created tension, with Clinton facing criticism for not doing enough to lower Palestinian expectations. Ultimately, the visit marked a significant moment in the peace process, but it also highlighted the complexities and challenges that remained to be addressed.\n\nThe visit also had implications for the political positions of President Clinton and Prime Minister Netanyahu. Clinton's efforts to promote dialogue and reduce tensions were seen as a key aspect of his presidency, while Netanyahu's refusal to agree to further troop withdrawals was seen as a major challenge to the peace process. The visit also highlighted the tensions between the two leaders, with Netanyahu expressing disappointment at Clinton's decision to visit the Palestinian airport in Gaza. Overall, the visit marked a significant moment in the peace process, but it also highlighted the complexities and challenges that remained to be addressed. In the end, the visit was a crucial step towards a peaceful resolution, but it also underscored the need for continued dialogue and cooperation between Israelis and Palestinians.", "k": 5}

Although delayed for a day, U.S. plans to launch the space shuttle Endeavour carrying the U.S. module Unity and six astronauts were carried out on Dec. 4. The astronauts' job was to connect Unity with the already-orbiting Zarya as the first step in assembling 100 major components of the planned space station. Using the shuttle's 50-foot robot arm, the two modules were joined setting the stage for a spacewalk by two astronauts the next day to attach electrical connectors and cables. The International Space Station when completed will have a million pound mass and be longer than a football field. It will house up to seven space explorers. The initial assembly of space station components involves linking the US Unity, carried into space by the shuttle Endeavour, with the Russian Zarya. The Russians had asked for a different launch profile in order to be able to transfer equipment from its MIR station, but that was not possible. Endeavour astronauts successfully completed the complicated maneuvers to join the two space objects. NASA estimates that 43 more launches will be required to completely assemble the 16-nation space station. On Friday the shuttle Endeavor carried six astronauts into orbit to start building an international space station. The launch occurred after Russia and U.S. officials agreed not to delay the flight in order to orbit closer to MIR, and after a last-minute alarm forced a postponement. On Sunday astronauts joining the Russian-made Zarya control module cylinder with the American-made module to form a 70,000 pounds mass 77 feet long. NASA estimates 43 more launches and 159 more space walks are needed to assemble the complex. When completed the 16-nation space station will be longer than a football field. It will be used to study adaptation to space flight. Russia and NASA jointly decided against a Russian cost-cutting proposal to orbit the 2nd space station, a 16-country cooperative project, closer to Mir, citing complexity, risk, and bad sun angles. After 5 years of assembly, the research station will house 7 people. A 12-day shuttle mission will attach the US Unity module to the Russian Zarya, already in orbit. Thursday's launch was delayed by a pressure drop. A 2nd attempt Friday was perfect. Unity was attached to Zarya in a blind docking using cameras and computer images. Electrical and cable connections come next. Unity will serve as a passageway for future modules. Two Zarya antennas failed to deploy.", "response": "The International Space Station (ISS) was launched and assembled through a series of complex and coordinated efforts involving multiple space agencies and spacecraft. On November 20, 1998, the Russian-built Zarya control module was launched aboard the Russian spacecraft Proton, marking the first stage of the ISS assembly process. The Zarya module was then captured by the space shuttle Endeavour's robotic arm, and attached to the Unity chamber, the first American-made module of the ISS. This historic connection was a significant milestone in the construction of the ISS, marking the beginning of a long-term partnership between NASA and the Russian Space Agency. The Endeavour's mission was a crucial step towards the completion of the orbiting complex, and the astronauts' work paved the way for future crews to continue the assembly process. The successful docking of the Zarya and Unity modules set the stage for a spacewalk by two astronauts to attach electrical connectors and cables between the two components. The ISS will eventually be assembled through 43 more launches and 159 more spacewalks, and will have a mass of 1 million pounds, be longer than a football field, and house up to seven astronauts and cosmonauts. The estimated time and resources needed to complete the ISS are substantial, with NASA estimating that the entire project will require 15 years or more to complete. The Endeavour's 12-day flight included three spacewalks to install handrails and other tools for future crews, marking an important step towards the completion of the space station. The ISS will be a testament to international cooperation and collaboration, and will provide a unique opportunity for scientists and researchers to conduct experiments and research in microgravity. The assembly process was a complex and challenging task, requiring the coordination of multiple space agencies and spacecraft, but the successful launch and initial assembly of the ISS marked the beginning of a new era in space exploration.

After an extravagant opening ceremony, the games went well despite a brief soccer brawl, a snooker game incident, the banning of Iran's equestrian team horses for not being disease free, and the withdrawal of Saudi Arabia over strained relations with Thailand. Thai police cleared the streets of beggars and criminals, and athletes were disciplined to avoid Bangkok's night life. China's recall of four soccer players from Europe is testimony of the importance of the games. The Asian Games scheduled for Bangkok Dec. 6-20, 1998 were never a sure thing. Thailand was in economic doldrums and there was question whether the sports complex for the games would be completed in time. By late October, however, it was clear the games could take place. Thai police rounded up beggars who might intimidate spectators, but then in late November Saudi Arabia withdrew its teams and there was concern that athletes might be tempted by Bangkok's nightlife and the availability of Viagra. But on Dec. 6 the games opened as scheduled as 6,000 athletes from 41 nations competed, including a heated snooker match between India and Pakistan. Despite economic problems and threats from the Asian Olympic Committee that it would move the games, Thailand was able to meet construction deadlines and open the 13th annual Asian Games to participants from 43 countries. The games have not been without controversy. In a surprise move, Saudi Arabia pulled its athletes from the games, probably in reprisal for a jewel theft and the murder of three of its diplomats.

Three prominent leaders of the China Democratic Party were put to trial and sentenced to 11-, 12- and 13-year prison terms. Germany and the U.S. condemned the arrests. A labor rights activist was released and exiled to the U.S. to blunt any opposition to Communist rule. U.S. policy to encourage trade and diplomacy in hope of democratic reforms evidences failure, but the U.S. is continuing its policy of encouragement. Friends of jailed dissidents state that they will continue to campaign for change. The US trade-driven policy of expanded ties encouraging Chinese democracy is questioned. China signed rights treaties and dissidents used new laws to set up China Democracy Party, but China violates the new laws by persecuting dissidents. It regularly frees activists from prison then exiles them so they lose local influence. It arrested an activist trying to register a rights monitoring group. CP leader Jiang's hard-line speech and publicity for activists sentenced to long prison terms signals a renewed Chinese crackdown. A rights activist expected to be sacrificed in the cause of democracy. Germany called China's sentencing of dissidents unacceptable. After 2 years of wooing the West by signing international accords, apparently relaxing controls on free speech, and releasing and exiling three dissenters, China cracked down against political dissent in Dec 1998. Leaders of the China Democracy Party (CDP) were arrested and three were sentenced to jail terms of 11 to 13 years. The West, including the US, UK and Germany, reacted strongly. Clinton's China policy of engagement was questioned. China's Jiang Zemin stated economic reform is not a prelude to democracy and vowed to crush any challenges to the Communist Party or \"social stability\". The CDP vowed to keep working, as more leaders awaited arrest. Xu Wenli, Wang Youchai, and Qin Yongmin, leading dissidents and prominent members of the China Democracy Party, were found guilty of subversion and sentenced to 13, 11, and 12 years in prison, respectively. Soon after the sentencing, China's president, Jiang Zemin, delivered speeches in which he asserted that Western political system must not be adopted and vowed to crush challenges to Communist Party rule.

Western nations condemned the sentences as violations of U.N. rights treaties signed by China.", "response": "The state of human rights in China remains a pressing concern, particularly with regards to the treatment of dissidents and political activists. As highlighted in context, the sentencing of three prominent dissidents, Xu Wenli, Wang Youcai, and Qin Yongming, to long jail sentences in 1994 raised questions about the effectiveness of the administration's policy of engaging China in hopes of democratic reform. The harsh prison terms were met with international condemnation, with the U.S. government and exiled dissidents calling for their immediate release. This incident was part of a larger crackdown on dissent, which saw at least 32 dissidents arrested or interrogated in the past three weeks.\n\nThe Chinese government's actions have been widely criticized by human rights groups, who view them as manipulative and cynical. For instance, the release of labor rights campaigner Liu Nianchun from prison ahead of Xu Wenli's trial was seen as an attempt to deflect international criticism. Similarly, the detention of Qin Yongmin, a prominent human rights campaigner, hours before China was expected to sign a key U.N. human rights treaty, was a clear indication of the government's disregard for human rights.\n\nThe international community has responded to China's human rights record with a mix of criticism and diplomatic engagement. The U.S. government has consistently condemned China's human rights abuses, while also maintaining diplomatic ties with the country. In contrast, some countries have been more willing to engage with China, despite its human rights record. The impact of China's international agreements and obligations on its human rights record is also a subject of debate. While China has ratified several key human rights treaties, its implementation of these agreements has been inconsistent, and it has often been accused of using them as a pretext for further repression.\n\nIn conclusion, the state of human rights in China remains a pressing concern, with the treatment of dissidents and political activists being a particular area of concern.

Ecevit, a former prime minister, was asked to form a new government. He was unable to win the support of Ciller for a secular coalition. Refusing any alliance with the Islamic Virtue Party, Ecevit turned to President Demirel to find another solution. Demirel was expected to turn to a widely trusted lawmaker to form Turkey's next government. New premier-designate Erez got backing from 2 key secular parties as he tried to form a broad-based secular coalition that would include some from the Virtue Party. Following charges that he interfered in a privatization contract and helped a businessman with mob ties, Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz was forced to resign. President Demeril asked Bulent Ecevit, former three-time prime minister from the 1970s and champion of Turkish Cypriot rights, to form a new government. After three weeks, Ecevit was unable to secure the support of the Center-Right Party. At issue was the participation of the Islamic Virtue Part in the secular government, Ecevit returned his mandate and Demeril named Valim Erez as prime minister designate. Erez was in talks with the Virtue Party over possible cabinet seats. Turkish PM Yilmaz was forced to step down due to mob ties and claims of state bank privatization tampering. President Demirel asked highly respected 3-time former PM Bulent Ecevit to form a new majority government. A split between parliament's center left and right is longstanding. Ecevit distrusted Yilmaz and Ciller but brought in Yilmaz's party and wooed Ciller's. She wouldn't join unless Islamic Virtue were included, which the secular parties resisted.

The last prime minister was voted out after charges of corruption and mob ties. Longtime politician and three-time prime minister, Ecevit, tried for two weeks to form a coalition, which would satisfy the staunchly secular military. He failed when he could not get the support of both center-right parties. The president then asked a member of Parliament to form an interim coalition government to serve until the April election. Erez attained center-right support if he sticks to secular principles, but he may be forced to give some Cabinet seats to the Islamic Virtue Party.", "response": "The current political situation in Turkey is marked by instability and division, with various parties vying for power and influence. As reported in, the chances for a strictly secular government in Turkey have faded, with the Islamic Virtue Party insisting on a share of power. This has led to opposition from the military, which has historically been a guardian of Turkey's secular system. Premier-designate Bulent Ecevit has been attempting to form a coalition government, but has faced resistance from various parties, including the Virtue Party and the two center-right parties, the Democratic Party and the True Path Party. Ecevit's efforts to form a coalition government have been unsuccessful, and he has announced that he is returning his mandate to the Turkish president. The previous government, led by Mesut Yilmaz, collapsed in a no-confidence vote in Parliament, with deputies accusing Yilmaz of entertaining ties with the mob and tampering with the sale of a state bank. Yilmaz has since been serving as acting premier. In a recent development, Yalim Erez, the latest premier-designate, has received the support of two key secular parties in his efforts to form a broad-based coalition government, but the Virtue Party has withheld its support. Erez has denied that he has discussed Cabinet posts with the Virtue Party, but the party is reportedly holding out for a number of Cabinet seats that reflect its standing as the largest party in parliament. The current situation is further complicated by the fact that the coalition government would only run the country until parliamentary elections set for April. Bulent Ecevit, who was asked to form a new government, has a reputation for being a strong defender of the cause of the Turkish Cypriots, and has been consistent in his support for the Turkish Cypriots throughout his career. However, Ecevit's stance on the issue of Cyprus has been a contentious one, and has been criticized by some as being too confrontational. In any case, Ecevit's failure to form a coalition government has raised questions about his ability to lead the country effectively. As noted in, Ecevit might try to form a fragile minority coalition, but this would likely be unstable and potentially short-lived. Alternatively, he might admit defeat and return the task of forming the government to President Suleyman Demirel, which could further complicate the already precarious political situation in Turkey. Overall, the current political situation in Turkey is characterized by division and instability, with various parties vying for power and influence. The country is likely to face further challenges in the coming months, particularly in the run-up to the parliamentary elections in April.

The remark fit Sharon's long history of unyielding bellicosity towards Palestine. When he was appointed some thought that Netanyahu was placating Israel's far right wing while striving for peace. Others saw it as a move to scuttle the peace effort. Arab commentary deemed the appointment \"tantamount to disaster\" and \"the bullet of mercy\" to the peace process. Peace talks in the U.S. were in the offing with the outcome in doubt. Appointment of Ariel Sharon as Foreign Minister by PM Netanyahu does not bode well for the peace process. His appointment is surprising in that the two have differed on withdrawal from Palestinian territory and is seen as an effort to placate the right. Sharon, 70, is an unapologetic warrior on the battlefield and in partisan politics. He brings heavy baggage: right-wing intransigence and responsibility for failing to prevent the killings of 460 unarmed Palestinians in refugee camps during the Lebanon incursion. Sharon has said that he will not shake Arafat's hand and his appointment is seen as a \"bullet of mercy\" for the Middle East peace process. Ariel Sharon was named Israeli foreign minister just weeks before a scheduled peace summit in the US, aimed at negotiating an Israeli withdrawal from 13% of the West Bank. Arabs reacted strongly and said the hard-line, right-wing, warrior and former defense minister would kill any progress for a settlement in the mid-East. Many blame Sharon for a 1982 massacre of Palestinian civilians at refugee camps in Lebanon. Others believed his appointment was an effort to placate the far right and gain their support for the Netanyahu government and the concessions necessary for the peace process. Sharon vowed not to shake Yasser Arafat's hand. In a move widely viewed as an effort to placate the far right as he moves to withdraw from more West Bank land, Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu named hardliner Ariel Sharon foreign minister and chief peace negotiator. Sharon, a military leader with legendary victories in the 1967 and 1973 Mideast wars, is infamous in the Arab world as the defense minister in the 1982 invasion of Lebanon during which Lebanese Christian militiamen, Israeli allies, slaughtered hundreds of unarmed Palestinians. His appointment as lead negotiator was denounced as a \"disaster\" in the Lebanese press and \"a bullet of mercy to the peace process\" in a Syrian paper.", "response": "The appointment of Ariel Sharon as Foreign Minister by Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu in 1998 was a significant development that had far-reaching implications for the Israeli-Palestinian peace process. As reported by, Netanyahu had been acting as foreign minister since January, when David Levy vacated the post. Levy's moderate approach to negotiations with the Palestinians was in stark contrast to Netanyahu's hardline stance, which was expected to be further entrenched by Sharon's appointment. Sharon's past actions, including his involvement in the 1982 invasion of Lebanon, had already raised concerns among the Arab community about his suitability for the role.\n\nThe Syrian newspaper, Tishrin, reflected the widespread skepticism about Sharon's appointment, declaring it a \"bullet of mercy\" to the peace process. This sentiment was echoed by The New York Times, which questioned whether Sharon, known for his long-standing opposition to the Palestinians, was truly prepared to make peace with them. The editorial highlighted the challenge that Netanyahu would face in controlling his strong-willed aide, a problem that had proven difficult for other Israeli leaders.\n\nSharon's own views on the peace process were also a concern. In an interview published on Sunday, he stated that he would not extend a hand to Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, even if he were appointed as foreign minister. This stance was in line with his long-standing opposition to ceding West Bank land to the Palestinians. As foreign minister, Sharon would play a crucial role in reaching a final peace settlement with the Palestinians, but his priorities seemed to lie elsewhere. As he stated, he would accept the foreign minister's job if he were allowed to \"act to strengthen the country\", a statement that suggested he would prioritize Israel's interests and security above all else.\n\nThe likely impact of Sharon's appointment on the Israeli-Palestinian peace process was a subject of much debate. Many believed that his hawkish approach would further strain relations with Arab neighbors, while others saw it as a necessary step to strengthen Israel's position in the region. One thing was certain, however: Sharon's appointment as foreign minister would be a significant shift in Israel's approach to peace negotiations with the Palestinians. As The New York Times noted, much would depend on Netanyahu's ability to control his strong-willed aide, a challenge that had proven difficult for other Israeli leaders. Ultimately, the success of the peace process would depend on Sharon's willingness to put the interests of both Israelis and Palestinians above his own priorities.

In September the U.S. initiated legal action against a Sudanese arrested in Germany and in November charges were prepared against six men including bin Laden. The U.S. had, in support of its case, documentary evidence and a cooperative former senior aide of bin Laden. Meanwhile, authorities reported bin Laden agents active in Bangladesh and the Balkans and the Taliban government of Afghanistan proclaimed bin Laden \"a man without sin. Evidence shows Sudanese factory bombed by US is linked to bin Laden. US prosecutors ask for an extension to extradite a bin Laden lieutenant. FBI questions witnesses of Nairobi embassy blast, preparing for trial of 6 suspects. The Taliban says the US is using bin Laden as an excuse to attack Afghanistan. Goal of US August raid there was to kill bin Laden and his aides. The Taliban declares bin Laden a free man, with no proof of anti-US terror. 2 arrested for articles inciting Taliban-style revolt in Bangladesh. Bin Laden cell is in Albania and elsewhere in Europe. Bin Laden aide informs for the US. East African bin Laden cell has security woes in '97. In the aftermath of the almost simultaneous bombings of U.S. embassies in East Africa, much has been learned of the terrorist network put together and financed by Saudi billionaire Osama bin Laden. Osama bin Laden, the mastermind of the bombings and U.S. cruise missile attack against a supposed terrorist camp in Afghanistan shortly after the bombings was an attempt not only to disrupt the terrorist network but to get bin Laden himself. As the investigation into the bombings continues, more is being learned from seized computers and top aides turned informants. Bin Laden remains in Afghanistan by permission of the Taliban. Following the bombings of the embassies in Africa, the US began a full-scale assault on Osama bin Laden. Attacked were a chemical plant in the Sudan and a camp in Afghanistan where he was believed to be, creating an assassination opportunity. Evidence was gathered from a captured computer and an in-law who defected. Suspects were identified and the FBI began to build a case in New York. Extradition of a suspect from Germany was sought. Reactions from Islamic nations varied: Afghanistan promised him safe haven; more liberal Bandladesh arrested pro-Taliban reporters; Albania feared it was an infiltration center for the rest of Europe, including Kosovo.", "response": "The US government's actions following the August 1998 bombings of the US embassies in East Africa were swift and decisive. The US launched a missile attack on suspected terrorist camps in eastern Afghanistan on August 20, killing 26 people, in retaliation for the bombings. This move was seen as a pretext for the US to launch another missile attack on Afghanistan, according to the Taliban's chief justice, Justice Noor Mohammed Saqib. The US government also initiated an investigation into the bombings, which led to the identification of a key informant, CS-1, who had been working closely with Osama bin Laden from 1989 to 1996. CS-1 provided crucial information to federal investigators, including details about bin Laden's involvement in deadly attacks on US soldiers in Somalia and elsewhere. The informant's testimony was instrumental in securing the extradition of two associates of bin Laden who were under arrest in Germany and Britain. The US government also took steps to prevent further terrorist attacks, including the arrest of individuals suspected of being part of bin Laden's network in Albania. The Albanian intelligence service, Shik, uncovered a terrorist network operated by bin Laden, which had sent units to fight in Kosovo. The US government also requested the extradition of Mamdouh Mahmud Salim, a top lieutenant of bin Laden, from Germany. US prosecutors requested a 20-day extension to provide Germany with the necessary paperwork to extradite Salim. The US government also obtained new evidence linking the owner of a Sudanese factory destroyed in a US cruise missile strike to a terrorist group backed by bin Laden. The evidence showed that Salih Idris, the owner of Al Shifa pharmaceutical plant, had financial dealings with members of Islamic Jihad, an Egypt-based group responsible for the assassination of President Anwar Sadat in 1981. In addition, FBI agents began questioning relatives of the victims of the Aug. 7 US Embassy bombing, as well as the seriously injured, to gather recorded testimony for use by the prosecution in the pre-sentencing phase of the trials of the six men indicted in connection with the attack. The reactions of foreign governments to these actions were mixed, with some countries, such as Bangladesh, not recognizing the Taliban government in Afghanistan. The arrest of journalists in Bangladesh highlighted the tension between the country's secular laws and the growing influence of Islamist ideologies. Overall, the US government's actions following the August 1998 bombings of the US embassies in East Africa were a significant response to the terrorist attacks, and marked the beginning of a long and complex investigation into bin Laden's activities.\n\nWord count: 499. \n\nReferences:\n The Associated Press.
