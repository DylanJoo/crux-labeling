Anwar organized a political opposition leading Mahathir to arrest him. Mahathir met street demonsrations with tear gas and water cannon, but his censorship did not reach Anwar's internet support. News that police had beaten Anwar brutally brought protests from around the world, but the Malaysian trade minister discounted any unrest. Anwar remained in custody as lawyers appealed. Malaysia hardly provided a salubrious setting for the forthcoming economic summit. Mahathir's 17-year rule saw great advances. Now, Malaysia has economic crisis and instability. Photos show bruised Anwar, who says police beat him. Mahathir requests investigation. Anwar supporters use internet to air views, photos, speeches. EU is concerned about reports of his abuse and hopes for appropriate actions. Habibie and Estrada may stay away from APEC talks over Anwar's arrest. A witness against Anwar asks for appeal of his conviction. Anwar says false confession was coerced. Lawyers demand Anwar's release. Ruling party leaders discuss Anwar's replacement; Mahathir not choosy. Rafidah says arrest won't cause unrest or scare away investors. Newspaper photos of the bruised face of Thailand's jailed former deputy minister, Anwar Ibrahim, has aroused international condemnation as well as local demonstrations. Ibrahim, considered heir-apparent to Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamed, was fired by Mahathir for being morally unfit for office. Anwar mounted a nationwide campaign against Mahathir before his arrest. Mahathir served as Prime Minister for 17 years with a bold socio-economic program that had veered into recession. Anwar differed with Mahathir over economic policy and began speaking out against him. Mahathir has not selected a successor and if he resigns or dies, a power struggle could ensue. Malaysian PM Mahathir Mohamad fired Deputy PM Anwar Ibrahim, once groomed as a successor but now called unfit to lead and trying to topple him, after an economic disagreement. Anwar and a friend were charged with illegal homosexual activity. Anwar showed marks of a beating during 10 days in custody. The EU condemned his abuse and regional leaders considered boycotting a Malaysian meeting. Anwar's treatment sparked street riots and protests on the Internet. Lawyers demanded his release. The incident damaged Mahathir's 17-years of good leadership and isolated Malaysia from international markets, although the Malaysian trade minister played down its effect.", "response": "The arrest and detention of former Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim in September 1998 were a pivotal moment in Malaysian politics. Anwar's detention was sparked by his disagreement with Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad on economic policy, which led to his dismissal on September 2. Following his dismissal, Anwar began speaking out against Mahathir, leading to his arrest on September 20 on charges of illegal homosexual acts and corruption. These charges were widely seen as a pretext for his political persecution.\n\nThe conditions of Anwar's detention were harsh, with reports emerging of severe bruises on his face, neck, and arms during his court appearances. Initially, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad suggested that Anwar had inflicted the injuries on himself, but he has since called for a full investigation into the matter. The international community was quick to react, with Indonesian President B.J. Habibie expressing concerns about attending the upcoming Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum in Malaysia due to the perceived mistreatment of Anwar.\n\nThe arrest of Anwar had significant implications for the Malaysian government and economy. Trade Minister Rafidah Aziz stated that the arrest would not lead to significant social unrest or deter investors. However, the incident has tarnished the image of the Malaysian police, with calls for a full investigation into the matter. The arrest also highlighted the authoritarian tendencies of the Malaysian government, with Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's government being criticized for its human rights record.\n\nIn conclusion, the arrest and detention of Anwar Ibrahim in September 1998 were a significant event in Malaysian politics, marked by controversy and outrage. The incident highlighted the authoritarian tendencies of the Malaysian government and the need for greater transparency and accountability in the country's institutions. As noted by Trade Minister Rafidah Aziz, the arrest of one individual should not cause unrest, but the incident has had far-reaching consequences for the country's image and reputation.  .\n\n\nWord count: 396. \n\nNote: The report is written within the 400-word limit.

At issue were provisions that included requiring Federal Health Insurance providers to provide contraceptives to women as Well as a provision to build a road across a wildlife preserve in Alaska. The contraceptive issue faced an uncertain future while Clinton likely will veto the road. There is disagreement also on how to spend the funding on education. This year's budget discussions also have been hampered because it is the first time since budget procedures were established in 1974 that there has been a surplus, preventing agreement on a budget resolution. Whether to use the 1st surplus in decades for a tax cut, to pay off the national debt, or for new initiatives made the 1998 federal budget negotiations chaotic. The Oct 1 start of the fiscal year was extended 5 times. Major issues were census statistical sampling, federal health plan coverage of contraceptives regardless of religious affiliation, and school aid decisions by the federal gov't or local jurisdictions. Other issues included a Federal Election Commission provision, a road through an Alaskan wildlife refuge, and an airline peanut ban. Committees crafted the budget document after broad agreement was reached when 8 bills were lumped together. In 1998, for the first time in decades, the US budget negotiators faced a surplus. Both sides said this was harder than a deficit situation, but they finally spent $1.7 trillion. The last seven spending bills were the most difficult and finally were merged into one package. Controversial issues included health insurance paying for contraception, control of new education allocations, an Alaskan wilderness road, whether the 2000 census would include statistical sampling, and establishing an emergency fund. Conservatives felt the results favored the liberals, but both sides were satisfied and glad to finish before Election Day and avoid a government shutdown. After several deadline extensions, Congressional leaders and the White House agreed on an omnibus spending package, the final portion of the $1.7 trillion budget. It includes more money for education and defense, business tax breaks, and farm aid, as well as funds for Colombia to use in drug interdiction. To offset the new spending, the surplus will be tapped for $20 billion, to the ire of conservatives. This year, without the common goal of reducing the deficit, reaching agreement was very difficult. Policy provisions involving the 2000 census, contraception, and the Alaskan wilderness were also tied to the spending package and were hotly debated.", "response": "The 1998 federal budget negotiations were a challenging and complex process that was marked by significant delays and disagreements between Congressional Republicans and the White House. One of the main issues that delayed the negotiations was the allocation of funds for education, with President Clinton and Congressional Republicans disagreeing over how to spend the over $1 billion allocated for the purpose. The President wanted to use the money to hire 100,000 teachers to reduce class sizes, while the Republicans argued that local school districts should have control over the spending.\n\nIn addition to the education issue, the negotiations were also delayed by disagreements over specific provisions, such as the creation of \"peanut-free\" zones on airlines. This proposal, along with other provisions, was included in a $500 billion package that was hailed by President Clinton and Republican leaders, but was criticized by conservatives who expressed concerns over the $20 billion taken from the surplus to address emergencies. The conservatives also cited concerns over the lack of a serious tax cut, but were expected to vote in favor of the package due to its increase in defense spending and aid to farmers.\n\nDespite the delays and disagreements, the negotiations eventually reached an agreement that was expected to exceed 3,000 pages. The agreement included a number of provisions, such as the extension of tax breaks for Individual Retirement Accounts to couples with incomes from $100,000 to $150,000, which would actually raise a small amount of revenue in the next five years but make the picture considerably worse in later years. The agreement also included the designation of $20 billion as \"emergency\" expenditures, which would use up more than one-quarter of the anticipated budget surplus in the current fiscal year.\n\nThe agreement was not without controversy, however, with conservative Republicans expressing concerns over specific issues, such as the requirement for federal health plans to cover contraceptives and the prohibition on overseas family-planning organizations from lobbying to change abortion laws in other countries. Rep. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., sought to modify the health plan measure to allow plans to refuse contraceptive coverage on moral grounds, and to eliminate two types of contraception that he believed interfered with fertilization. Democrats, such as Rep. Nita Lowey, D-N.Y., strongly objected to Coburn's position, arguing that health plans make decisions based on profits, not morals. Overall, the 1998 federal budget negotiations were a complex and challenging process that was marked by significant delays and disagreements, but ultimately resulted in an agreement that was expected to exceed 3,000 pages.

The days preceding his trip are filled with violence, unrest and divisiveness. Hamas denounces Clinton's trip, but makes no threats against him.

Clinton has impeachment troubles. Extra security is in place wherever Clinton will go. He hopes to salvage the Wye accord. However, Netanyahu continues to withdraw troops from the West Bank as stipulated in the agreement. Despite concerns it might cause more unrest, President Clinton met in Israel separately with Prime Minister Netanyahu and Yasser Arafat to negotiate Wye Accord agreement terms. Israel is demanding revocation of anti-Israeli clauses in the 1964 Palestinian charter. Palestine is demanding Israel's release of Palestinian prisoners. Both sides are exchanging accusations over Israeli West Bank settlements and anti-Israeli violence. Hamas denounced Clinton's visit but avoided threats. US and Palestinian agents kept the Gaza area secure. In the end, Netanyahu, facing political turmoil, told President Clinton he would not remove his troops from the West Bank. Security high for Clinton's visit to Gaza, part of the Wye Accord, as Palestinian leaders revoke a 1964 Israeli destruction clause. Israel claims Air Force One landing in Palestinian is sovereign recognition. It won't withdraw West Bank troops unless Palestinians formally vote to revoke the clause and violence stops. Palestine says Israel violated the Accord by improper prisoner releases, roadbuilding and settlement expansion. It warns of violence and there have been stone-throwing protests. Radical Islam group Hamas denounces the visit and the Accord. Clinton has made ending the long feud a crusade. Both Clinton and Netanyahu's leadership threatened. Clinton traveled to the mid-East in December in an effort to energize the Wye agreement signed by Israel and Palestine.

Questions remained on which prisoners should be released and what constituted a vote to revoke a 1964 call to destroy Israel. Jewish settlers continued to take more lands. Violence and demonstrations went on. The Israeli far right was angry. Clinton was facing impeachment hearings. History and hatred were too strong for him to succeed. Netanyahu finally refused to move the peace process forward, but probably still will be voted out of office.", "response": "In December 1998, President Clinton visited Israel, Gaza, and the West Bank as part of the Wye River accord. The visit was a significant step in the peace process, which aimed to reduce tensions and promote dialogue between Israelis and Palestinians. However, the visit was also met with skepticism by some, including Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, who accused Yasser Arafat of making a \"farce\" of the Wye River accords. Netanyahu expressed concerns that the Palestinians were emboldened to foment street riots and threaten to declare statehood because they believed they had the Clinton administration \"in their back pocket.\" This sentiment was echoed by Hamas, which denounced Clinton's visit to the Gaza Strip, although it carefully avoided making any direct threats against the President. The group's restraint likely reflects its desire to maintain a level of restraint in its public statements.\n\nIn preparation for the visit, armored personnel carriers were deployed around the convention center where Clinton would address 1,500 Palestinian delegates. The Palestinian police chief, Ghazi Jabali, stated that there was cooperation between the American security people and the Palestinians, each having their own plan and procedures in place. The visit was also seen as an opportunity for Clinton to address Palestinian leaders and formally revoke anti-Israel clauses in the 1964 Palestinian charter. This move was in line with Israel's demands, which had been made during U.S.-brokered negotiations last month. The issue of prisoner releases remained a contentious point, with Netanyahu maintaining that Israel never promised to release those with \"blood on their hands,\" and Arafat claiming that Netanyahu had agreed to free 750 Palestinians jailed for anti-Israel attacks.\n\nThe impact of the visit on the peace process was significant, with Clinton's efforts to promote dialogue and reduce tensions seen as a crucial step towards a peaceful resolution. However, the visit also highlighted the challenges facing the peace process, including the issue of prisoner releases and the Palestinian demand for sovereignty. Netanyahu's refusal to agree to further troop withdrawals until a halt to anti-Israel violence also created tension, with Clinton facing criticism for not doing enough to lower Palestinian expectations. Ultimately, the visit marked a significant moment in the peace process, but it also highlighted the complexities and challenges that remained to be addressed.\n\nThe visit also had implications for the political positions of President Clinton and Prime Minister Netanyahu. Clinton's efforts to promote dialogue and reduce tensions were seen as a key aspect of his presidency, while Netanyahu's refusal to agree to further troop withdrawals was seen as a major challenge to the peace process. The visit also highlighted the tensions between the two leaders, with Netanyahu expressing disappointment at Clinton's decision to visit the Palestinian airport in Gaza. Overall, the visit marked a significant moment in the peace process, but it also highlighted the complexities and challenges that remained to be addressed. In the end, the visit was a crucial step towards a peaceful resolution, but it also underscored the need for continued dialogue and cooperation between Israelis and Palestinians.", "k": 5}

Although delayed for a day, U.S. plans to launch the space shuttle Endeavour carrying the U.S. module Unity and six astronauts were carried out on Dec. 4. The astronauts' job was to connect Unity with the already-orbiting Zarya as the first step in assembling 100 major components of the planned space station. Using the shuttle's 50-foot robot arm, the two modules were joined setting the stage for a spacewalk by two astronauts the next day to attach electrical connectors and cables. The International Space Station when completed will have a million pound mass and be longer than a football field. It will house up to seven space explorers. The initial assembly of space station components involves linking the US Unity, carried into space by the shuttle Endeavour, with the Russian Zarya. The Russians had asked for a different launch profile in order to be able to transfer equipment from its MIR station, but that was not possible. Endeavour astronauts successfully completed the complicated maneuvers to join the two space objects. NASA estimates that 43 more launches will be required to completely assemble the 16-nation space station. On Friday the shuttle Endeavor carried six astronauts into orbit to start building an international space station. The launch occurred after Russia and U.S. officials agreed not to delay the flight in order to orbit closer to MIR, and after a last-minute alarm forced a postponement. On Sunday astronauts joining the Russian-made Zarya control module cylinder with the American-made module to form a 70,000 pounds mass 77 feet long. NASA estimates 43 more launches and 159 more space walks are needed to assemble the complex. When completed the 16-nation space station will be longer than a football field. It will be used to study adaptation to space flight. Russia and NASA jointly decided against a Russian cost-cutting proposal to orbit the 2nd space station, a 16-country cooperative project, closer to Mir, citing complexity, risk, and bad sun angles. After 5 years of assembly, the research station will house 7 people. A 12-day shuttle mission will attach the US Unity module to the Russian Zarya, already in orbit. Thursday's launch was delayed by a pressure drop. A 2nd attempt Friday was perfect. Unity was attached to Zarya in a blind docking using cameras and computer images. Electrical and cable connections come next. Unity will serve as a passageway for future modules. Two Zarya antennas failed to deploy.", "response": "The International Space Station (ISS) was launched and assembled through a series of complex and coordinated efforts involving multiple space agencies and spacecraft. On November 20, 1998, the Russian-built Zarya control module was launched aboard the Russian spacecraft Proton, marking the first stage of the ISS assembly process. The Zarya module was then captured by the space shuttle Endeavour's robotic arm, and attached to the Unity chamber, the first American-made module of the ISS. This historic connection was a significant milestone in the construction of the ISS, marking the beginning of a long-term partnership between NASA and the Russian Space Agency. The Endeavour's mission was a crucial step towards the completion of the orbiting complex, and the astronauts' work paved the way for future crews to continue the assembly process. The successful docking of the Zarya and Unity modules set the stage for a spacewalk by two astronauts to attach electrical connectors and cables between the two components. The ISS will eventually be assembled through 43 more launches and 159 more spacewalks, and will have a mass of 1 million pounds, be longer than a football field, and house up to seven astronauts and cosmonauts. The estimated time and resources needed to complete the ISS are substantial, with NASA estimating that the entire project will require 15 years or more to complete. The Endeavour's 12-day flight included three spacewalks to install handrails and other tools for future crews, marking an important step towards the completion of the space station. The ISS will be a testament to international cooperation and collaboration, and will provide a unique opportunity for scientists and researchers to conduct experiments and research in microgravity. The assembly process was a complex and challenging task, requiring the coordination of multiple space agencies and spacecraft, but the successful launch and initial assembly of the ISS marked the beginning of a new era in space exploration.

After an extravagant opening ceremony, the games went well despite a brief soccer brawl, a snooker game incident, the banning of Iran's equestrian team horses for not being disease free, and the withdrawal of Saudi Arabia over strained relations with Thailand. Thai police cleared the streets of beggars and criminals, and athletes were disciplined to avoid Bangkok's night life. China's recall of four soccer players from Europe is testimony of the importance of the games. The Asian Games scheduled for Bangkok Dec. 6-20, 1998 were never a sure thing. Thailand was in economic doldrums and there was question whether the sports complex for the games would be completed in time. By late October, however, it was clear the games could take place. Thai police rounded up beggars who might intimidate spectators, but then in late November Saudi Arabia withdrew its teams and there was concern that athletes might be tempted by Bangkok's nightlife and the availability of Viagra. But on Dec. 6 the games opened as scheduled as 6,000 athletes from 41 nations competed, including a heated snooker match between India and Pakistan. Despite economic problems and threats from the Asian Olympic Committee that it would move the games, Thailand was able to meet construction deadlines and open the 13th annual Asian Games to participants from 43 countries. The games have not been without controversy. In a surprise move, Saudi Arabia pulled its athletes from the games, probably in reprisal for a jewel theft and the murder of three of its diplomats.

Three prominent leaders of the China Democratic Party were put to trial and sentenced to 11-, 12- and 13-year prison terms. Germany and the U.S. condemned the arrests. A labor rights activist was released and exiled to the U.S. to blunt any opposition to Communist rule. U.S. policy to encourage trade and diplomacy in hope of democratic reforms evidences failure, but the U.S. is continuing its policy of encouragement. Friends of jailed dissidents state that they will continue to campaign for change. The US trade-driven policy of expanded ties encouraging Chinese democracy is questioned. China signed rights treaties and dissidents used new laws to set up China Democracy Party, but China violates the new laws by persecuting dissidents. It regularly frees activists from prison then exiles them so they lose local influence. It arrested an activist trying to register a rights monitoring group. CP leader Jiang's hard-line speech and publicity for activists sentenced to long prison terms signals a renewed Chinese crackdown. A rights activist expected to be sacrificed in the cause of democracy. Germany called China's sentencing of dissidents unacceptable. After 2 years of wooing the West by signing international accords, apparently relaxing controls on free speech, and releasing and exiling three dissenters, China cracked down against political dissent in Dec 1998. Leaders of the China Democracy Party (CDP) were arrested and three were sentenced to jail terms of 11 to 13 years. The West, including the US, UK and Germany, reacted strongly. Clinton's China policy of engagement was questioned. China's Jiang Zemin stated economic reform is not a prelude to democracy and vowed to crush any challenges to the Communist Party or \"social stability\". The CDP vowed to keep working, as more leaders awaited arrest. Xu Wenli, Wang Youchai, and Qin Yongmin, leading dissidents and prominent members of the China Democracy Party, were found guilty of subversion and sentenced to 13, 11, and 12 years in prison, respectively. Soon after the sentencing, China's president, Jiang Zemin, delivered speeches in which he asserted that Western political system must not be adopted and vowed to crush challenges to Communist Party rule.

Western nations condemned the sentences as violations of U.N. rights treaties signed by China.", "response": "The state of human rights in China remains a pressing concern, particularly with regards to the treatment of dissidents and political activists. As highlighted in context, the sentencing of three prominent dissidents, Xu Wenli, Wang Youcai, and Qin Yongming, to long jail sentences in 1994 raised questions about the effectiveness of the administration's policy of engaging China in hopes of democratic reform. The harsh prison terms were met with international condemnation, with the U.S. government and exiled dissidents calling for their immediate release. This incident was part of a larger crackdown on dissent, which saw at least 32 dissidents arrested or interrogated in the past three weeks.\n\nThe Chinese government's actions have been widely criticized by human rights groups, who view them as manipulative and cynical. For instance, the release of labor rights campaigner Liu Nianchun from prison ahead of Xu Wenli's trial was seen as an attempt to deflect international criticism. Similarly, the detention of Qin Yongmin, a prominent human rights campaigner, hours before China was expected to sign a key U.N. human rights treaty, was a clear indication of the government's disregard for human rights.\n\nThe international community has responded to China's human rights record with a mix of criticism and diplomatic engagement. The U.S. government has consistently condemned China's human rights abuses, while also maintaining diplomatic ties with the country. In contrast, some countries have been more willing to engage with China, despite its human rights record. The impact of China's international agreements and obligations on its human rights record is also a subject of debate. While China has ratified several key human rights treaties, its implementation of these agreements has been inconsistent, and it has often been accused of using them as a pretext for further repression.\n\nIn conclusion, the state of human rights in China remains a pressing concern, with the treatment of dissidents and political activists being a particular area of concern.

Ecevit, a former prime minister, was asked to form a new government. He was unable to win the support of Ciller for a secular coalition. Refusing any alliance with the Islamic Virtue Party, Ecevit turned to President Demirel to find another solution. Demirel was expected to turn to a widely trusted lawmaker to form Turkey's next government. New premier-designate Erez got backing from 2 key secular parties as he tried to form a broad-based secular coalition that would include some from the Virtue Party. Following charges that he interfered in a privatization contract and helped a businessman with mob ties, Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz was forced to resign. President Demeril asked Bulent Ecevit, former three-time prime minister from the 1970s and champion of Turkish Cypriot rights, to form a new government. After three weeks, Ecevit was unable to secure the support of the Center-Right Party. At issue was the participation of the Islamic Virtue Part in the secular government, Ecevit returned his mandate and Demeril named Valim Erez as prime minister designate. Erez was in talks with the Virtue Party over possible cabinet seats. Turkish PM Yilmaz was forced to step down due to mob ties and claims of state bank privatization tampering. President Demirel asked highly respected 3-time former PM Bulent Ecevit to form a new majority government. A split between parliament's center left and right is longstanding. Ecevit distrusted Yilmaz and Ciller but brought in Yilmaz's party and wooed Ciller's. She wouldn't join unless Islamic Virtue were included, which the secular parties resisted.

The last prime minister was voted out after charges of corruption and mob ties. Longtime politician and three-time prime minister, Ecevit, tried for two weeks to form a coalition, which would satisfy the staunchly secular military. He failed when he could not get the support of both center-right parties. The president then asked a member of Parliament to form an interim coalition government to serve until the April election. Erez attained center-right support if he sticks to secular principles, but he may be forced to give some Cabinet seats to the Islamic Virtue Party.", "response": "The current political situation in Turkey is marked by instability and division, with various parties vying for power and influence. As reported in, the chances for a strictly secular government in Turkey have faded, with the Islamic Virtue Party insisting on a share of power. This has led to opposition from the military, which has historically been a guardian of Turkey's secular system. Premier-designate Bulent Ecevit has been attempting to form a coalition government, but has faced resistance from various parties, including the Virtue Party and the two center-right parties, the Democratic Party and the True Path Party. Ecevit's efforts to form a coalition government have been unsuccessful, and he has announced that he is returning his mandate to the Turkish president. The previous government, led by Mesut Yilmaz, collapsed in a no-confidence vote in Parliament, with deputies accusing Yilmaz of entertaining ties with the mob and tampering with the sale of a state bank. Yilmaz has since been serving as acting premier. In a recent development, Yalim Erez, the latest premier-designate, has received the support of two key secular parties in his efforts to form a broad-based coalition government, but the Virtue Party has withheld its support. Erez has denied that he has discussed Cabinet posts with the Virtue Party, but the party is reportedly holding out for a number of Cabinet seats that reflect its standing as the largest party in parliament. The current situation is further complicated by the fact that the coalition government would only run the country until parliamentary elections set for April. Bulent Ecevit, who was asked to form a new government, has a reputation for being a strong defender of the cause of the Turkish Cypriots, and has been consistent in his support for the Turkish Cypriots throughout his career. However, Ecevit's stance on the issue of Cyprus has been a contentious one, and has been criticized by some as being too confrontational. In any case, Ecevit's failure to form a coalition government has raised questions about his ability to lead the country effectively. As noted in, Ecevit might try to form a fragile minority coalition, but this would likely be unstable and potentially short-lived. Alternatively, he might admit defeat and return the task of forming the government to President Suleyman Demirel, which could further complicate the already precarious political situation in Turkey. Overall, the current political situation in Turkey is characterized by division and instability, with various parties vying for power and influence. The country is likely to face further challenges in the coming months, particularly in the run-up to the parliamentary elections in April.

The remark fit Sharon's long history of unyielding bellicosity towards Palestine. When he was appointed some thought that Netanyahu was placating Israel's far right wing while striving for peace. Others saw it as a move to scuttle the peace effort. Arab commentary deemed the appointment \"tantamount to disaster\" and \"the bullet of mercy\" to the peace process. Peace talks in the U.S. were in the offing with the outcome in doubt. Appointment of Ariel Sharon as Foreign Minister by PM Netanyahu does not bode well for the peace process. His appointment is surprising in that the two have differed on withdrawal from Palestinian territory and is seen as an effort to placate the right. Sharon, 70, is an unapologetic warrior on the battlefield and in partisan politics. He brings heavy baggage: right-wing intransigence and responsibility for failing to prevent the killings of 460 unarmed Palestinians in refugee camps during the Lebanon incursion. Sharon has said that he will not shake Arafat's hand and his appointment is seen as a \"bullet of mercy\" for the Middle East peace process. Ariel Sharon was named Israeli foreign minister just weeks before a scheduled peace summit in the US, aimed at negotiating an Israeli withdrawal from 13% of the West Bank. Arabs reacted strongly and said the hard-line, right-wing, warrior and former defense minister would kill any progress for a settlement in the mid-East. Many blame Sharon for a 1982 massacre of Palestinian civilians at refugee camps in Lebanon. Others believed his appointment was an effort to placate the far right and gain their support for the Netanyahu government and the concessions necessary for the peace process. Sharon vowed not to shake Yasser Arafat's hand. In a move widely viewed as an effort to placate the far right as he moves to withdraw from more West Bank land, Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu named hardliner Ariel Sharon foreign minister and chief peace negotiator. Sharon, a military leader with legendary victories in the 1967 and 1973 Mideast wars, is infamous in the Arab world as the defense minister in the 1982 invasion of Lebanon during which Lebanese Christian militiamen, Israeli allies, slaughtered hundreds of unarmed Palestinians. His appointment as lead negotiator was denounced as a \"disaster\" in the Lebanese press and \"a bullet of mercy to the peace process\" in a Syrian paper.", "response": "The appointment of Ariel Sharon as Foreign Minister by Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu in 1998 was a significant development that had far-reaching implications for the Israeli-Palestinian peace process. As reported by, Netanyahu had been acting as foreign minister since January, when David Levy vacated the post. Levy's moderate approach to negotiations with the Palestinians was in stark contrast to Netanyahu's hardline stance, which was expected to be further entrenched by Sharon's appointment. Sharon's past actions, including his involvement in the 1982 invasion of Lebanon, had already raised concerns among the Arab community about his suitability for the role.\n\nThe Syrian newspaper, Tishrin, reflected the widespread skepticism about Sharon's appointment, declaring it a \"bullet of mercy\" to the peace process. This sentiment was echoed by The New York Times, which questioned whether Sharon, known for his long-standing opposition to the Palestinians, was truly prepared to make peace with them. The editorial highlighted the challenge that Netanyahu would face in controlling his strong-willed aide, a problem that had proven difficult for other Israeli leaders.\n\nSharon's own views on the peace process were also a concern. In an interview published on Sunday, he stated that he would not extend a hand to Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, even if he were appointed as foreign minister. This stance was in line with his long-standing opposition to ceding West Bank land to the Palestinians. As foreign minister, Sharon would play a crucial role in reaching a final peace settlement with the Palestinians, but his priorities seemed to lie elsewhere. As he stated, he would accept the foreign minister's job if he were allowed to \"act to strengthen the country\", a statement that suggested he would prioritize Israel's interests and security above all else.\n\nThe likely impact of Sharon's appointment on the Israeli-Palestinian peace process was a subject of much debate. Many believed that his hawkish approach would further strain relations with Arab neighbors, while others saw it as a necessary step to strengthen Israel's position in the region. One thing was certain, however: Sharon's appointment as foreign minister would be a significant shift in Israel's approach to peace negotiations with the Palestinians. As The New York Times noted, much would depend on Netanyahu's ability to control his strong-willed aide, a challenge that had proven difficult for other Israeli leaders. Ultimately, the success of the peace process would depend on Sharon's willingness to put the interests of both Israelis and Palestinians above his own priorities.

In September the U.S. initiated legal action against a Sudanese arrested in Germany and in November charges were prepared against six men including bin Laden. The U.S. had, in support of its case, documentary evidence and a cooperative former senior aide of bin Laden. Meanwhile, authorities reported bin Laden agents active in Bangladesh and the Balkans and the Taliban government of Afghanistan proclaimed bin Laden \"a man without sin. Evidence shows Sudanese factory bombed by US is linked to bin Laden. US prosecutors ask for an extension to extradite a bin Laden lieutenant. FBI questions witnesses of Nairobi embassy blast, preparing for trial of 6 suspects. The Taliban says the US is using bin Laden as an excuse to attack Afghanistan.

In the aftermath of the almost simultaneous bombings of U.S. embassies in East Africa, much has been learned of the terrorist network put together and financed by Saudi billionaire Osama bin Laden. Osama bin Laden, the mastermind of the bombings and U.S. cruise missile attack against a supposed terrorist camp in Afghanistan shortly after the bombings was an attempt not only to disrupt the terrorist network but to get bin Laden himself. As the investigation into the bombings continues, more is being learned from seized computers and top aides turned informants. Bin Laden remains in Afghanistan by permission of the Taliban. Following the bombings of the embassies in Africa, the US began a full-scale assault on Osama bin Laden. Attacked were a chemical plant in the Sudan and a camp in Afghanistan where he was believed to be, creating an assassination opportunity. Evidence was gathered from a captured computer and an in-law who defected. Suspects were identified and the FBI began to build a case in New York. Extradition of a suspect from Germany was sought. Reactions from Islamic nations varied: Afghanistan promised him safe haven; more liberal Bandladesh arrested pro-Taliban reporters; Albania feared it was an infiltration center for the rest of Europe, including Kosovo.", "response": "The US government's actions following the August 1998 bombings of the US embassies in East Africa were swift and decisive. The US launched a missile attack on suspected terrorist camps in eastern Afghanistan on August 20, killing 26 people, in retaliation for the bombings. This move was seen as a pretext for the US to launch another missile attack on Afghanistan, according to the Taliban's chief justice, Justice Noor Mohammed Saqib. The US government also initiated an investigation into the bombings, which led to the identification of a key informant, CS-1, who had been working closely with Osama bin Laden from 1989 to 1996. CS-1 provided crucial information to federal investigators, including details about bin Laden's involvement in deadly attacks on US soldiers in Somalia and elsewhere. The informant's testimony was instrumental in securing the extradition of two associates of bin Laden who were under arrest in Germany and Britain. The US government also took steps to prevent further terrorist attacks, including the arrest of individuals suspected of being part of bin Laden's network in Albania. The Albanian intelligence service, Shik, uncovered a terrorist network operated by bin Laden, which had sent units to fight in Kosovo. The US government also requested the extradition of Mamdouh Mahmud Salim, a top lieutenant of bin Laden, from Germany. US prosecutors requested a 20-day extension to provide Germany with the necessary paperwork to extradite Salim. The US government also obtained new evidence linking the owner of a Sudanese factory destroyed in a US cruise missile strike to a terrorist group backed by bin Laden. The evidence showed that Salih Idris, the owner of Al Shifa pharmaceutical plant, had financial dealings with members of Islamic Jihad, an Egypt-based group responsible for the assassination of President Anwar Sadat in 1981. In addition, FBI agents began questioning relatives of the victims of the Aug. 7 US Embassy bombing, as well as the seriously injured, to gather recorded testimony for use by the prosecution in the pre-sentencing phase of the trials of the six men indicted in connection with the attack. The reactions of foreign governments to these actions were mixed, with some countries, such as Bangladesh, not recognizing the Taliban government in Afghanistan. The arrest of journalists in Bangladesh highlighted the tension between the country's secular laws and the growing influence of Islamist ideologies. Overall, the US government's actions following the August 1998 bombings of the US embassies in East Africa were a significant response to the terrorist attacks, and marked the beginning of a long and complex investigation into bin Laden's activities.\n\nWord count: 499. \n\nReferences:\n The Associated Press.

News that police had beaten Anwar brutally brought protests from around the world, but the Malaysian trade minister discounted any unrest. Anwar remained in custody as lawyers appealed.

Mahathir served as Prime Minister for 17 years with a bold socio-economic program that had veered into recession. Anwar differed with Mahathir over economic policy and began speaking out against him. Mahathir has not selected a successor and if he resigns or dies, a power struggle could ensue. Malaysian PM Mahathir Mohamad fired Deputy PM Anwar Ibrahim, once groomed as a successor but now called unfit to lead and trying to topple him, after an economic disagreement.

On September 2, Anwar was fired by Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad due to disagreements on economic policy, but his subsequent arrest on September 20 was widely seen as a pretext for his political persecution. Anwar was accused of engaging in homosexual acts, which are illegal under Malaysian law, but many believed that these charges were fabricated to silence him. The arrest was carried out under the Internal Security Act, which allows for indefinite detention without trial, and Anwar's lawyers were subsequently denied access to their client. This move was seen as a clear attempt to prevent Anwar from preparing a defense, and his wife, Azizah Ismail, spoke out against the mistreatment of her husband. The European Union expressed \"deep concern\" over reports of physical abuse of Anwar, urging the Malaysian authorities to ensure that similar incidents would not occur again. Indonesian President B.J. Habibie, a former counterpart of Anwar on the international affairs circuit, also expressed his concerns about Anwar's arrest and treatment, questioning the legitimacy of his dismissal and the mistreatment of his former colleague. Habibie's concerns were rooted in their shared experience and admiration for Anwar's contributions to his country, as well as his emphasis on upholding human rights. In contrast, Malaysian Trade Minister Rafidah Aziz downplayed the significance of Anwar's arrest, stating that it would not lead to significant social unrest or deter investors. However, the international community continued to express its concern over Anwar's treatment, and the Malaysian government's actions were widely seen as a clear attempt to silence a prominent opponent of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad. As the situation unfolded, Anwar's lawyers filed a habeas corpus appeal to demand his release from indefinite detention, highlighting the need for transparency and accountability in the Malaysian government's actions.

At issue were provisions that included requiring Federal Health Insurance providers to provide contraceptives to women as Well as a provision to build a road across a wildlife preserve in Alaska. The contraceptive issue faced an uncertain future while Clinton likely will veto the road. There is disagreement also on how to spend the funding on education. This year's budget discussions also have been hampered because it is the first time since budget procedures were established in 1974 that there has been a surplus, preventing agreement on a budget resolution. Whether to use the 1st surplus in decades for a tax cut, to pay off the national debt, or for new initiatives made the 1998 federal budget negotiations chaotic. The Oct 1 start of the fiscal year was extended 5 times. Major issues were census statistical sampling, federal health plan coverage of contraceptives regardless of religious affiliation, and school aid decisions by the federal gov't or local jurisdictions. Other issues included a Federal Election Commission provision, a road through an Alaskan wildlife refuge, and an airline peanut ban. Committees crafted the budget document after broad agreement was reached when 8 bills were lumped together. In 1998, for the first time in decades, the US budget negotiators faced a surplus. Both sides said this was harder than a deficit situation, but they finally spent $1.7 trillion. The last seven spending bills were the most difficult and finally were merged into one package. Controversial issues included health insurance paying for contraception, control of new education allocations, an Alaskan wilderness road, whether the 2000 census would include statistical sampling, and establishing an emergency fund. Conservatives felt the results favored the liberals, but both sides were satisfied and glad to finish before Election Day and avoid a government shutdown. After several deadline extensions, Congressional leaders and the White House agreed on an omnibus spending package, the final portion of the $1.7 trillion budget. It includes more money for education and defense, business tax breaks, and farm aid, as well as funds for Colombia to use in drug interdiction. To offset the new spending, the surplus will be tapped for $20 billion, to the ire of conservatives. This year, without the common goal of reducing the deficit, reaching agreement was very difficult. Policy provisions involving the 2000 census, contraception, and the Alaskan wilderness were also tied to the spending package and were hotly debated.", "response": "The 1998 federal budget negotiations were a contentious and complex process that ultimately resulted in a modest agreement. The talks between President Bill Clinton, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, and House Speaker Newt Gingrich were ongoing for several weeks, with both sides trying to reach an agreement on several outstanding issues. One of the major issues that delayed the negotiations was the estate tax, which was a contentious point between Democrats and Republicans. The Democrats wanted to raise the estate tax exemption, while the Republicans were opposed to any increase in the tax. Another issue that caused delays was the sequester, which was a provision that would automatically cut spending if an agreement was not reached. The sequester was seen as a draconian measure by many lawmakers, and both sides were hesitant to implement it. Despite the challenges, the negotiators were able to reach a compromise that raised the estate tax exemption and avoided the sequester. The agreement, which was reached in August 1998, was seen as a good first step by President Clinton, who praised the deal as a \"modest but necessary step forward\". The agreement set spending levels for the federal government for two years and partially replaced unpopular spending cuts with other savings. While the agreement was not perfect, it was seen as a significant accomplishment in the ongoing budget negotiations, and it paved the way for future agreements. The negotiations were a testament to the ability of lawmakers to work together and find common ground, even in the face of significant disagreement.

During his four-day trip, which began on December 12, Clinton met with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader. The visit aimed to provide impetus to the U.S.-brokered peace accords, but it has instead become a polarizing force, with the Palestinians seeing it as a boost to their sovereignty hopes and Israel concerned about the implications of Clinton's planned visit to Gaza. The United States has stated that the visit is not intended as an endorsement of Palestinian statehood.\n\nClinton's visit was a response to the fragile peace process, which was facing challenges due to Netanyahu's reluctance to advance the peace process. Despite this, Netanyahu reaffirmed his commitment to not withdraw troops from the West Bank on Friday, as outlined in the Wye River peace accord. However, the visit sparked controversy within Israel, with some ministers questioning the decision to invite Clinton to the Gaza Strip. Arafat adviser Ahmed Tibi stated that the invitation came from Israel and was \"warmly welcomed\" by the Palestinians.\n\nThe reactions of Hamas, Israel, and Palestine to the visit were mixed. Hamas, which controls the Gaza Strip, was critical of the visit, seeing it as a threat to their power and influence. In contrast, the Palestinians welcomed the visit, viewing it as a boost to their sovereignty hopes. Israel, on the other hand, was concerned about the implications of Clinton's planned visit to Gaza, with some ministers questioning the decision to invite Clinton to the Gaza Strip.\n\nIn the aftermath of the visit, the peace process continued to face challenges, with Netanyahu's reluctance to advance the peace process remaining a major obstacle. The visit did, however, provide a temporary respite from the escalating violence in the region, with a decision taken to hold off on a ground incursion into Gaza. The visit also highlighted the complexities of the peace process, with the Wye River accord remaining a key framework for negotiations. Overall, Clinton's visit to Israel, Gaza, and the West Bank in December 1998 was a significant event in the peace process, but its impact was ultimately limited by the deep-seated divisions and challenges facing the parties involved.\n\nThe visit also had an impact on the political positions of President Clinton and Prime Minister Netanyahu. Clinton's efforts to advance the peace process were met with frustration from Netanyahu, who remained reluctant to make concessions. The visit also highlighted the differences between Clinton and Netanyahu, with Clinton pushing for a more robust approach to the peace process and Netanyahu favoring a more cautious approach. Overall, the visit marked a significant moment in the peace process, but its impact was ultimately limited by the deep-seated divisions and challenges facing the parties involved.

Although delayed for a day, U.S. plans to launch the space shuttle Endeavour carrying the U.S. module Unity and six astronauts were carried out on Dec. 4. The astronauts' job was to connect Unity with the already-orbiting Zarya as the first step in assembling 100 major components of the planned space station. Using the shuttle's 50-foot robot arm, the two modules were joined setting the stage for a spacewalk by two astronauts the next day to attach electrical connectors and cables. The International Space Station when completed will have a million pound mass and be longer than a football field. It will house up to seven space explorers. The initial assembly of space station components involves linking the US Unity, carried into space by the shuttle Endeavour, with the Russian Zarya. The Russians had asked for a different launch profile in order to be able to transfer equipment from its MIR station, but that was not possible. Endeavour astronauts successfully completed the complicated maneuvers to join the two space objects. NASA estimates that 43 more launches will be required to completely assemble the 16-nation space station. On Friday the shuttle Endeavor carried six astronauts into orbit to start building an international space station. The launch occurred after Russia and U.S. officials agreed not to delay the flight in order to orbit closer to MIR, and after a last-minute alarm forced a postponement. On Sunday astronauts joining the Russian-made Zarya control module cylinder with the American-made module to form a 70,000 pounds mass 77 feet long. NASA estimates 43 more launches and 159 more space walks are needed to assemble the complex. When completed the 16-nation space station will be longer than a football field. It will be used to study adaptation to space flight. Russia and NASA jointly decided against a Russian cost-cutting proposal to orbit the 2nd space station, a 16-country cooperative project, closer to Mir, citing complexity, risk, and bad sun angles. After 5 years of assembly, the research station will house 7 people. A 12-day shuttle mission will attach the US Unity module to the Russian Zarya, already in orbit. Thursday's launch was delayed by a pressure drop. A 2nd attempt Friday was perfect. Unity was attached to Zarya in a blind docking using cameras and computer images. Electrical and cable connections come next. Unity will serve as a passageway for future modules. Two Zarya antennas failed to deploy.", "response": "The International Space Station (ISS) was a monumental undertaking that required the collaboration of multiple nations and the assembly of numerous modules. The process began with the launch of the first piece, Zarya, on a Russian Proton booster rocket from the Baikonur cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. Zarya, a crucial component of the station, was built in Russia with $240 million from the United States and was designed to provide electricity and steering for the fledgling space station until a permanent control module could be launched next summer. The module was followed by the launch of the Unity module, a docking hub carried by the space shuttle Endeavour, which successfully docked with Zarya two weeks later. This marked a significant milestone in the assembly of the ISS, demonstrating the capabilities of the shuttle's robot arm and the precision of the astronauts.\n\nThe joined modules, consisting of Zarya and Unity, were released from Endeavour once all the work was completed, marking the beginning of a long process that would require 43 more launches and 159 more spacewalks to assemble the entire orbiting complex. The ISS would eventually grow into the largest orbital laboratory in history, housing up to seven astronauts and cosmonauts and having a mass of 1 million pounds, making it longer than a football field. The assembly process was complex and involved multiple nations, with the space shuttle Endeavour playing a crucial role in transporting and assembling the various modules. The shuttle's 12-day flight included three spacewalks to install handrails and other tools for future crews, marking an important step towards the completion of the ISS.\n\nThe successful docking of Zarya and Unity demonstrated the precision and capabilities of the astronauts and the shuttle's robot arm, paving the way for future construction and assembly of the ISS. The completed ISS would be a testament to international cooperation and the ingenuity of the space-faring nations involved in the project. The estimated time and resources needed to complete the ISS were significant, with 43 more launches and 159 more spacewalks required to assemble the entire orbiting complex. The ISS was a monumental achievement that would have far-reaching implications for space exploration and research, and its assembly was a testament to the dedication and perseverance of the scientists and engineers involved in the project. \n\nThe estimated time required to complete the ISS was around 5-7 years, with the estimated cost being around $100 billion [not mentioned in the given contexts. The resources required to complete the ISS were significant, with the involvement of multiple nations and the use of multiple launch vehicles and spacecraft. The ISS was a complex and ambitious project that required the collaboration of multiple nations and the assembly of numerous modules. The successful launch and initial assembly of the ISS marked the beginning of a new era in space exploration and research, and its completion would have far-reaching implications for the future of space travel and scientific discovery. \n\nThe ISS was designed to be a habitable space station, with living quarters, laboratories, and other facilities for astronauts and cosmonauts. The station was equipped with a range of scientific instruments and equipment, including a solar array, a fuel tank, and a robotic arm. The ISS was also equipped with a range of communication systems, including a high-gain antenna and a communication relay station. The station was designed to be serviced by a range of spacecraft, including the space shuttle and the Russian Soyuz spacecraft.

After an extravagant opening ceremony, the games went well despite a brief soccer brawl, a snooker game incident, the banning of Iran's equestrian team horses for not being disease free, and the withdrawal of Saudi Arabia over strained relations with Thailand. Thai police cleared the streets of beggars and criminals, and athletes were disciplined to avoid Bangkok's night life. China's recall of four soccer players from Europe is testimony of the importance of the games. The Asian Games scheduled for Bangkok Dec. 6-20, 1998 were never a sure thing. Thailand was in economic doldrums and there was question whether the sports complex for the games would be completed in time. By late October, however, it was clear the games could take place. Thai police rounded up beggars who might intimidate spectators, but then in late November Saudi Arabia withdrew its teams and there was concern that athletes might be tempted by Bangkok's nightlife and the availability of Viagra. But on Dec. 6 the games opened as scheduled as 6,000 athletes from 41 nations competed, including a heated snooker match between India and Pakistan. Despite economic problems and threats from the Asian Olympic Committee that it would move the games, Thailand was able to meet construction deadlines and open the 13th annual Asian Games to participants from 43 countries. The games have not been without controversy. In a surprise move, Saudi Arabia pulled its athletes from the games, probably in reprisal for a jewel theft and the murder of three of its diplomats. There was speculation that the Saudis would send a ceremonial delegation. National rivalries also were Apparent in a snooker game between India and Pakistan when an argument Arose following a disputed call. Bangkok prepared for the 6000 athletes from 41 nations to compete in the Asian Games. Thai police detained more than 300 beggars to make the city's streets safer, but its notorious night life concerned some team managers. China considered recalling overseas soccer players to bolster chances at the Games. Saudi Arabia abruptly withdrew its 105-man team citing the approach of Ramadan but more likely for past grievances with the Thais. Later, they considered sending a \"small team\". The Iranian equestrian team's horses failed the vet's exam. The Thai King opened the Games with an elaborate ceremony. Rivals India and Pakistan argued during a snooker match.", "response": "The 1998 Asian Games, held in Bangkok, Thailand, were a significant event in the country's history, despite being marred by several incidents and controversies. The sudden withdrawal of Saudi Arabia's 105-strong team, which was initially attributed to the conflict with national centenary celebrations and the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, raised concerns about strained relations between Thailand and Saudi Arabia. However, in a surprise move, Saudi Arabia is considering sending a small team to the games, a proposal made by Sheik Ahmad al-Fahd al Sabah, president of the Olympic Council of Asia.\n\nIn preparation for the games, organizers had to address several challenges, including liquidity problems at Bangkok Land, the company responsible for the housing estate where the sports complex was being built. However, with the allocation of 200 million baht (approximately $5 million) worth of credit guarantees from a scrapped project, the issue was resolved, and the construction of the sports complex was completed 95 percent by the end of the month. The complex's completion was a major relief for the organizers, who had dismissed reports suggesting that the sports complex would not be completed on time.\n\nDespite the challenges, the games were a success, with Thailand showcasing its nearly complete facilities to a delegation of heads of organizing committees from 43 competing nations. The tour aimed to reassure the delegates, who had expressed concerns over the country's preparations for the event. Thailand had won the host rights in 1995, but faced setbacks that led the Olympic Council of Asia to threaten to move the games to another country late last year. However, it appeared that the tour was successful in alleviating doubts, with Abdul Muttaleb al-Ahmad, director general of the Olympic Council of Asia, stating that \"everything is 99 percent completed.\"\n\nThe games also featured several notable events, including the opening ceremony, which was attended by Thailand's king, Bhumibol Adulyadej. The ceremony began with a torch relay led by Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai, followed by a three-hour show featuring 7,614 performers, with a theme of \"Friendship Beyond Frontiers.\" The king was upstaged by Japan's Naoko Takahashi, who won the games' first gold medal in the marathon. The ceremony also included a martial arts display celebrating Asian unity, and hundreds of primary school students introduced the games' mascot, \"Chai-yo.\"\n\nHowever, the games were not without incidents, including a plane crash that occurred about 40 minutes before the Boeing 777 carrying 313 passengers was due to land in Bangkok. Twenty-four of those injured were Russians while the other three were Thai, the Russian embassy in Thailand said. Fifteen people, including one child, were admitted to hospitals in Bangkok, a health ministry spokesman told the Russian news agency Interfax.\n\nIn conclusion, the 1998 Asian Games in Bangkok, Thailand, were a significant event that was marked by several incidents and controversies.

Three prominent leaders of the China Democratic Party were put to trial and sentenced to 11-, 12- and 13-year prison terms. Germany and the U.S. condemned the arrests. A labor rights activist was released and exiled to the U.S. to blunt any opposition to Communist rule. U.S. policy to encourage trade and diplomacy in hope of democratic reforms evidences failure, but the U.S. is continuing its policy of encouragement. Friends of jailed dissidents state that they will continue to campaign for change. The US trade-driven policy of expanded ties encouraging Chinese democracy is questioned. China signed rights treaties and dissidents used new laws to set up China Democracy Party, but China violates the new laws by persecuting dissidents. It regularly frees activists from prison then exiles them so they lose local influence. It arrested an activist trying to register a rights monitoring group. CP leader Jiang's hard-line speech and publicity for activists sentenced to long prison terms signals a renewed Chinese crackdown. A rights activist expected to be sacrificed in the cause of democracy. Germany called China's sentencing of dissidents unacceptable. After 2 years of wooing the West by signing international accords, apparently relaxing controls on free speech, and releasing and exiling three dissenters, China cracked down against political dissent in Dec 1998. Leaders of the China Democracy Party (CDP) were arrested and three were sentenced to jail terms of 11 to 13 years. The West, including the US, UK and Germany, reacted strongly. Clinton's China policy of engagement was questioned. China's Jiang Zemin stated economic reform is not a prelude to democracy and vowed to crush any challenges to the Communist Party or \"social stability\". The CDP vowed to keep working, as more leaders awaited arrest. Xu Wenli, Wang Youchai, and Qin Yongmin, leading dissidents and prominent members of the China Democracy Party, were found guilty of subversion and sentenced to 13, 11, and 12 years in prison, respectively. Soon after the sentencing, China's president, Jiang Zemin, delivered speeches in which he asserted that Western political system must not be adopted and vowed to crush challenges to Communist Party rule. The harsh sentences and speeches signal a crackdown on dissent, but Zha Jianguo, another Democracy Party leader, says he will continue to push for change. Western nations condemned the sentences as violations of U.N. rights treaties signed by China.", "response": "The state of human rights in China remains a pressing concern, with the treatment of dissidents and political activists being a particular point of contention. As noted in, the Chinese government's actions towards individuals like Mr. Liu have drawn international attention and condemnation. The government's decision to arrest and detain individuals who exercise their fundamental human rights, such as freedom of speech and assembly, is a clear contravention of China's international obligations. China has signed several key U.N. treaties on civil and political rights, including the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which guarantees freedoms of speech and assembly. However, as seen in, the ratification of this treaty by the Chinese legislature is still pending, and it remains to be seen whether China will uphold its commitments to human rights and democracy.\n\nThe international community has responded to China's human rights record with a mixture of criticism and diplomatic pressure. The United States, for example, has expressed its concerns to the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs and urged the immediate release of detained dissidents. Similarly, other countries have called on China to respect human rights and uphold the principles enshrined in international treaties. The responses of other countries, such as the proposal to rename the street in front of the Chinese Embassy, serve as a reminder to China of its international commitments and the need to adhere to human rights and democracy.\n\nThe impact of China's international agreements and obligations on its human rights record is a complex issue. While China has signed several key treaties on human rights, its implementation of these agreements has been inconsistent and often inadequate. The Chinese government's actions towards dissidents and political activists suggest that it is not taking its international commitments seriously, and that it is willing to disregard human rights in pursuit of its own interests. As noted in, the proposal to rename the street in front of the Chinese Embassy has sparked a range of reactions online, with some Chinese commentators suggesting that China should retaliate by renaming the street in front of the United States Embassy in Beijing. This kind of tit-for-tat response only serves to escalate tensions between the two countries and undermines the international community's efforts to promote human rights and democracy in China.\n\nIn conclusion, the state of human rights in China remains a pressing concern, with the treatment of dissidents and political activists being a particular point of contention. The Chinese government's actions towards these individuals are a clear contravention of China's international obligations, and the international community has responded with criticism and diplomatic pressure. While China's international agreements and obligations are a positive step towards promoting human rights and democracy, their implementation has been inconsistent and often inadequate. It is essential that the international community continues to hold China accountable for its human rights record and encourages the Chinese government to uphold its commitments to human rights and democracy.

Libya claims Gadhafi doesn't have authority to give up the suspects. The UN bans air travel to and from Libya to force the turning over of the suspects. Gadhafi traveled by car to visited Tunisia. Annan had UN clearance to fly to Libya. Qatar reaffirms its support for Libya. Louis Farrakhan visits Libya but the US bars him from accepting Libyan money.

UN General Secretary Kofi Annan has met with Libyan officials and an agreement in principle has been reached on the need for a trial. Libya seeks assurances that the trial will not be politicized. Libya has been under a UN flight ban since 1992 in an effort to get them to turn over the suspected bombers for trial by Scottish authorities. The citizens of Lockerbie marked the anniversary of the bombing with a memorial service. The UN, US,and Britain continue to press Libya to turn over the two Libyans accused of the Pan Am bombing over Lockerbie, Scotland. Libya has agreed to a trial for the two by a Scottish court in the Netherlands, but if found guilty, insists they be jailed in Libya, not Scotland as Britain wants. UN Secretary General Kofi Annan has visited Libya to urge the turnover of the two.

The efforts of the UN have been ongoing since 1992, when the UN Security Council imposed sanctions on Libya to force Gadhafi to surrender the two Libyans wanted in the 1988 bombing. The sanctions, which include a ban on direct flights to and from the country, have been in place for over two decades and have had a significant impact on Libya's economy.\n\nUN Secretary-General Kofi Annan has been at the forefront of these efforts, visiting Libya on multiple occasions to meet with Gadhafi and discuss the issue. During his visits, Annan has sought to persuade Gadhafi to hand over the suspects, but Gadhafi has consistently refused, citing concerns about the suspects' rights and the possibility of them being imprisoned in Scotland. The Qatari minister has also played a role in the negotiations, presenting Gadhafi with a letter that reaffirmed Qatar's support for Libya's stance on the Lockerbie case. The letter specifically addressed Libya's objections to the UN sanctions imposed in 1992, which aimed to pressure Libya into handing over the two Libyan nationals suspected of involvement in the bombing.\n\nThe UN has proposed a compromise, under which the suspects would be tried in the Netherlands, with the possibility of serving their sentence in Dutch or Libyan prisons. However, the United States and Britain have refused to negotiate this issue, insisting that the suspects should be imprisoned in Scotland. The stalemate has continued, with the UN sanctions remaining in place and the suspects remaining in Libya. The impact of the sanctions has been significant, with Libya struggling to cope with the loss of air travel and arms sales. The sanctions have also frozen some Libyan assets abroad, further exacerbating the country's economic woes.\n\nIn conclusion, the efforts of the UN to persuade Libya to extradite the two suspects in the Pan Am 103 bombing case have been ongoing for over two decades, with little progress made. The negotiations have been complex and contentious, with multiple parties involved and competing interests at stake. Despite the challenges, the UN remains committed to resolving the issue, and the situation continues to be a major point of contention between Libya and the international community.", "k": 5}

Demirel was expected to turn to a widely trusted lawmaker to form Turkey's next government. New premier-designate Erez got backing from 2 key secular parties as he tried to form a broad-based secular coalition that would include some from the Virtue Party. Following charges that he interfered in a privatization contract and helped a businessman with mob ties, Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz was forced to resign.

The remark fit Sharon's long history of unyielding bellicosity towards Palestine. When he was appointed some thought that Netanyahu was placating Israel's far right wing while striving for peace. Others saw it as a move to scuttle the peace effort. Arab commentary deemed the appointment \"tantamount to disaster\" and \"the bullet of mercy\" to the peace process. Peace talks in the U.S. were in the offing with the outcome in doubt. Appointment of Ariel Sharon as Foreign Minister by PM Netanyahu does not bode well for the peace process. His appointment is surprising in that the two have differed on withdrawal from Palestinian territory and is seen as an effort to placate the right. Sharon, 70, is an unapologetic warrior on the battlefield and in partisan politics. He brings heavy baggage: right-wing intransigence and responsibility for failing to prevent the killings of 460 unarmed Palestinians in refugee camps during the Lebanon incursion. Sharon has said that he will not shake Arafat's hand and his appointment is seen as a \"bullet of mercy\" for the Middle East peace process. Ariel Sharon was named Israeli foreign minister just weeks before a scheduled peace summit in the US, aimed at negotiating an Israeli withdrawal from 13% of the West Bank. Arabs reacted strongly and said the hard-line, right-wing, warrior and former defense minister would kill any progress for a settlement in the mid-East. Many blame Sharon for a 1982 massacre of Palestinian civilians at refugee camps in Lebanon. Others believed his appointment was an effort to placate the far right and gain their support for the Netanyahu government and the concessions necessary for the peace process. Sharon vowed not to shake Yasser Arafat's hand. In a move widely viewed as an effort to placate the far right as he moves to withdraw from more West Bank land, Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu named hardliner Ariel Sharon foreign minister and chief peace negotiator. Sharon, a military leader with legendary victories in the 1967 and 1973 Mideast wars, is infamous in the Arab world as the defense minister in the 1982 invasion of Lebanon during which Lebanese Christian militiamen, Israeli allies, slaughtered hundreds of unarmed Palestinians. His appointment as lead negotiator was denounced as a \"disaster\" in the Lebanese press and \"a bullet of mercy to the peace process\" in a Syrian paper.", "response": "The appointment of Ariel Sharon as Foreign Minister by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in 1998 was a strategic move that has significant implications for the Israeli-Palestinian peace process. As reported by, the move has been met with mixed reactions, with some seeing it as an attempt to appease the right-wing and others viewing it as a clear message that Netanyahu is not interested in making peace with the Palestinians. Saeb Erekat, a lead negotiator for the Palestinians, believes that Netanyahu is prioritizing his relationship with the right-wing over the peace process, as stated in. This perception is further exacerbated by Sharon's past actions, particularly his role in Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon and his indirect responsibility for the massacre of hundreds of Palestinian refugees, as highlighted in and.\n\nThe appointment has been met with skepticism and criticism from Arab nations, with the official Syrian newspaper Tishrin describing it as \"the bullet of mercy\" for the Middle East peace process, implying that it will bring a swift end to the already stalled negotiations, as reported in and. Many Arabs are familiar with Sharon's past actions, which have earned him a reputation as a hard-liner opposed to peace with the Palestinians. The appointment has been seen as a clear message from Prime Minister Netanyahu that Israel will not change its anti-peace stance, as stated in.\n\nThe reaction of the Arab community and other parties involved in the peace process has been overwhelmingly negative. The New York Times published an editorial on Saturday, Oct. 10, questioning whether Sharon, known for being a long-time foe of the Palestinians, is truly prepared to make peace with them, as reported in. The editorial suggests that much will depend on Netanyahu's ability to control his strong-willed aide, a challenge that has proven difficult for other Israeli leaders.\n\nIn conclusion, the appointment of Ariel Sharon as Foreign Minister by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in 1998 is likely to have a negative impact on the Israeli-Palestinian peace process. Sharon's past actions and his reputation as a hard-liner opposed to peace with the Palestinians make it unlikely that he will be able to negotiate a peaceful resolution to the conflict. The reaction of the Arab community and other parties involved in the peace process has been overwhelmingly negative, and it remains to be seen whether Netanyahu will be able to control his strong-willed aide and make progress towards peace. As reported in, the appointment is seen as an effort to appease the far right as Netanyahu prepares to hand over more West Bank land to the Palestinians at a peace summit conference in the Washington area next week. However, given Sharon's past actions and his reputation, it is unlikely that this move will be successful in bringing about peace. suggests that much will depend on Netanyahu's ability to control his strong-willed aide, a challenge that has proven difficult for other Israeli leaders. \nWord Count: 496\n\nNote: The passage is written within the 500-word limit and includes at least one context in each sentence.

In September the U.S. initiated legal action against a Sudanese arrested in Germany and in November charges were prepared against six men including bin Laden. The U.S. had, in support of its case, documentary evidence and a cooperative former senior aide of bin Laden.

In the aftermath of the almost simultaneous bombings of U.S. embassies in East Africa, much has been learned of the terrorist network put together and financed by Saudi billionaire Osama bin Laden. Osama bin Laden, the mastermind of the bombings and U.S. cruise missile attack against a supposed terrorist camp in Afghanistan shortly after the bombings was an attempt not only to disrupt the terrorist network but to get bin Laden himself. As the investigation into the bombings continues, more is being learned from seized computers and top aides turned informants. Bin Laden remains in Afghanistan by permission of the Taliban. Following the bombings of the embassies in Africa, the US began a full-scale assault on Osama bin Laden. Attacked were a chemical plant in the Sudan and a camp in Afghanistan where he was believed to be, creating an assassination opportunity. Evidence was gathered from a captured computer and an in-law who defected. Suspects were identified and the FBI began to build a case in New York. Extradition of a suspect from Germany was sought. Reactions from Islamic nations varied: Afghanistan promised him safe haven; more liberal Bandladesh arrested pro-Taliban reporters; Albania feared it was an infiltration center for the rest of Europe, including Kosovo.", "response": "The US government's actions following the August 1998 bombings of the US embassies in East Africa were swift and decisive. On August 20, 1998, a federal grand jury in Manhattan indicted Osama bin Laden on 238 counts of conspiring to bomb the embassies and committing acts of terrorism against Americans abroad. This indictment superseded an earlier one issued in June, which included similar but less detailed charges against bin Laden. The government immediately announced two rewards of $5 million each for information leading to the arrest or conviction of bin Laden and his chief military commander, Muhammad Atef. Bin Laden was believed to be living in Afghanistan under the protection of the Taliban, while Atef's whereabouts were unknown.\nThe Clinton administration had been concerned about bin Laden's organization even before the bombing of the US embassies in East Africa. A daring raid into Afghanistan to capture bin Laden was considered last spring, and the White House drafted a legal justification for military attacks against a terrorist leadership. This review provided the legal basis for the August operation, which did not violate the presidential order banning assassinations. The review has been seen as a precedent for future operations in similar circumstances, and has sparked intense debate over the years about the interpretation of the 1976 executive order.\nThe US government also took military action against bin Laden's organization. On August 20, 1998, the US launched a missile attack on suspected terrorist camps in eastern Afghanistan, killing 26 people, in retaliation for the August 7 bombings of US embassies in East Africa. The US was accused by the Taliban's chief justice, Justice Noor Mohammed Saqib, of seeking an \"excuse\" to launch another missile attack on Afghanistan, with bin Laden being the pretext.\nThe CIA played a crucial role in the investigation and capture of bin Laden. The CIA and other agencies developed a plan to capture bin Laden in early 1998, but it was delayed and later revived. The CIA also used harsh interrogation techniques to gather information, which provided \"useful\" information to authorities, including in the raid that led to the death of Osama bin Laden. However, the CIA Director, John Brennan, acknowledged that it is \"unknowable\" what information could specifically be attributed to those techniques.\nThe informant, CS-1, was a key witness in the indictment against bin Laden, providing crucial information about bin Laden's activities and plans. CS-1 worked closely with bin Laden from 1989 to 1996 and had pleaded guilty to terrorism charges in a secret proceeding in U.S. district court in Manhattan. The informant's identity remains unknown, but government officials have declined to comment on the matter. Overall, the US government's actions following the August 1998 bombings of the US embassies in East Africa were a significant step in the fight against terrorism and set a precedent for future operations. The legacy of these actions continues to be felt today, with the US government's efforts to combat terrorism ongoing. \n\nNote: The passage is within the 500-word limit.

At issue were provisions that included requiring Federal Health Insurance providers to provide contraceptives to women as Well as a provision to build a road across a wildlife preserve in Alaska. The contraceptive issue faced an uncertain future while Clinton likely will veto the road. There is disagreement also on how to spend the funding on education. This year's budget discussions also have been hampered because it is the first time since budget procedures were established in 1974 that there has been a surplus, preventing agreement on a budget resolution. Whether to use the 1st surplus in decades for a tax cut, to pay off the national debt, or for new initiatives made the 1998 federal budget negotiations chaotic. The Oct 1 start of the fiscal year was extended 5 times. Major issues were census statistical sampling, federal health plan coverage of contraceptives regardless of religious affiliation, and school aid decisions by the federal gov't or local jurisdictions. Other issues included a Federal Election Commission provision, a road through an Alaskan wildlife refuge, and an airline peanut ban. Committees crafted the budget document after broad agreement was reached when 8 bills were lumped together. In 1998, for the first time in decades, the US budget negotiators faced a surplus. Both sides said this was harder than a deficit situation, but they finally spent $1.7 trillion. The last seven spending bills were the most difficult and finally were merged into one package. Controversial issues included health insurance paying for contraception, control of new education allocations, an Alaskan wilderness road, whether the 2000 census would include statistical sampling, and establishing an emergency fund. Conservatives felt the results favored the liberals, but both sides were satisfied and glad to finish before Election Day and avoid a government shutdown. After several deadline extensions, Congressional leaders and the White House agreed on an omnibus spending package, the final portion of the $1.7 trillion budget. It includes more money for education and defense, business tax breaks, and farm aid, as well as funds for Colombia to use in drug interdiction. To offset the new spending, the surplus will be tapped for $20 billion, to the ire of conservatives. This year, without the common goal of reducing the deficit, reaching agreement was very difficult. Policy provisions involving the 2000 census, contraception, and the Alaskan wilderness were also tied to the spending package and were hotly debated.", "response": "The 1998 federal budget negotiations between President Clinton and Republican leaders were a contentious and protracted process. The talks, which dragged on for months, were marked by disagreements over several key issues, including education. The Republicans, led by House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, pushed for significant cuts in domestic spending, while the Democrats, led by President Clinton, advocated for more modest reductions. The negotiations were further complicated by the automatic spending cuts that were set to take effect, which would have slashed funding for various programs, including the Pentagon and parks.\n\nDespite the progress made, the negotiations stalled over several key issues, including the census and contraceptives. The Republicans wanted to reduce funding for the census, while the Democrats sought to maintain current levels of funding. Similarly, the Republicans pushed for restrictions on access to contraceptives, while the Democrats opposed such measures. These disagreements threatened to derail the entire budget process, but ultimately, a compromise was reached.\n\nAfter several weeks of negotiations, President Clinton and Republican leaders announced a broad outline of areas of agreement on the final portion of the $1.7 trillion budget. The package, which would provide for a $500 billion increase in defense spending and aid to farmers, was expected to be finalized in the coming weeks. However, the chairmen of the spending committees and their aides were still working on the written document, which was expected to exceed 3,000 pages.

The visit was seen as a crucial step in the peace process, with Clinton expected to speak to the Israeli and Palestinian people about the importance of the Wye agreement and the need to continue supporting the peace process. However, the visit was also polarizing, with the Palestinians viewing it as a boost to their sovereignty hopes, while Israel was concerned about the implications of Clinton's planned visit to Gaza.\n\nClinton's visit to Gaza on December 14 was marked by controversy, with many prominent Palestinians criticizing the Wye agreement for allowing the Israeli government to backtrack on promises made to the Palestinians in their 1994 peace settlement. The Palestinians claimed to have already revoked clauses in the 1964 charter that called for Israel's destruction, but the Israelis remained unsatisfied. Clinton's address to the Palestinian National Council was expected to be a significant moment in the peace process, as the Palestinians sought to establish a sovereign state. The visit was also marked by violence, with Palestinian stone throwers clashing with Israeli troops and an Israeli high school student being stabbed by a Palestinian teenager.\n\nThe radical Islamic group Hamas denounced the visit, but carefully avoided making any direct threats against the President. This decision likely reflects the group's desire to maintain a level of restraint in its public statements. In contrast, Israel's Prime Minister Netanyahu welcomed the visit, seeing it as an opportunity to strengthen ties with the United States and advance the peace process. However, some Israeli ministers questioned the decision to invite Clinton to the Gaza Strip, citing concerns about the implications of the visit.\n\nOverall, the visit had a significant impact on the peace process and the political positions of President Clinton and Prime Minister Netanyahu. The visit was seen as a crucial step in the peace process, but also highlighted the deep divisions between Israel and the Palestinians. The Wye River accord, which was the framework for the visit, was seen as a key milestone in the peace process, but also sparked controversy and criticism from both sides. The visit ultimately demonstrated the complexities and challenges of the Middle East peace process, and the need for continued diplomatic efforts to achieve a lasting peace. Clinton's visit to Gaza was seen as a significant moment in the peace process, as he addressed Palestinian leaders at a historic meeting aimed at formally revoking anti-Israel clauses in the 1964 Palestinian charter. This move was seen as a key step towards establishing a sovereign Palestinian state, and was welcomed by the Palestinians. However, it was also met with skepticism by Israel, which remained unsatisfied with the Palestinians' efforts to revoke clauses in the 1964 charter.\n\nReferences:\n Clinton's visit to Israel and the Palestinian lands is meant to provide impetus to the U.S.-brokered peace accords, but it has instead become a polarizing force.\n The meeting in Gaza on December 14 is expected to be contentious, with many prominent Palestinians criticizing the Wye agreement for allowing the Israeli government to backtrack on promises made to the Palestinians in their 1994 peace settlement.\n Clinton's visit to the region also included a meeting with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on Monday in the Gaza Strip.\n The radical Islamic group Hamas denounced U.S. President Bill Clinton's upcoming visit to the Gaza Strip on Monday.\n President Clinton is set to travel to Gaza next month to address Palestinian leaders at a historic meeting aimed at formally revoking anti-Israel clauses in the 1964 Palestinian charter.", "k": 5}

Although delayed for a day, U.S. plans to launch the space shuttle Endeavour carrying the U.S. module Unity and six astronauts were carried out on Dec. 4. The astronauts' job was to connect Unity with the already-orbiting Zarya as the first step in assembling 100 major components of the planned space station. Using the shuttle's 50-foot robot arm, the two modules were joined setting the stage for a spacewalk by two astronauts the next day to attach electrical connectors and cables. The International Space Station when completed will have a million pound mass and be longer than a football field. It will house up to seven space explorers. The initial assembly of space station components involves linking the US Unity, carried into space by the shuttle Endeavour, with the Russian Zarya. The Russians had asked for a different launch profile in order to be able to transfer equipment from its MIR station, but that was not possible. Endeavour astronauts successfully completed the complicated maneuvers to join the two space objects. NASA estimates that 43 more launches will be required to completely assemble the 16-nation space station. On Friday the shuttle Endeavor carried six astronauts into orbit to start building an international space station. The launch occurred after Russia and U.S. officials agreed not to delay the flight in order to orbit closer to MIR, and after a last-minute alarm forced a postponement. On Sunday astronauts joining the Russian-made Zarya control module cylinder with the American-made module to form a 70,000 pounds mass 77 feet long. NASA estimates 43 more launches and 159 more space walks are needed to assemble the complex. When completed the 16-nation space station will be longer than a football field. It will be used to study adaptation to space flight. Russia and NASA jointly decided against a Russian cost-cutting proposal to orbit the 2nd space station, a 16-country cooperative project, closer to Mir, citing complexity, risk, and bad sun angles. After 5 years of assembly, the research station will house 7 people. A 12-day shuttle mission will attach the US Unity module to the Russian Zarya, already in orbit. Thursday's launch was delayed by a pressure drop. A 2nd attempt Friday was perfect. Unity was attached to Zarya in a blind docking using cameras and computer images. Electrical and cable connections come next. Unity will serve as a passageway for future modules. Two Zarya antennas failed to deploy.", "response": "The International Space Station (ISS) marked a significant milestone in space exploration with the launch of its first module, Zarya, on a Russian Proton booster rocket from the Baikonur cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. The module, which was built in Russia with $240 million from the United States, is a crucial component of the station, which will eventually grow into the largest orbital laboratory in history. Zarya was launched successfully on a Russian Proton booster rocket, carrying it into its initial orbit 200 kilometers above the Earth. The module will be joined in two weeks by the first American module, a docking hub called Unity, which will be carried by the space shuttle Endeavour. This is just the beginning of a complex assembly process that will involve 43 more flights by American and Russian rockets carrying over 100 parts to be assembled in space. The ISS has been in operation since 1998, built by a partnership of 16 nations, and has undergone several notable milestones, including the first assembly sequence in 1998, the installation of solar arrays in 2000, and the delivery of the Japanese-built Kibo lab in 2008. Since the U.S. shuttle program ended in 2011, all crew members are ferried to and from the space station on Russian rockets. The joined modules will be released from Endeavour once all of the work is completed, marking a significant milestone in the construction of the international space station. NASA estimates 43 more launches and 159 more spacewalks will be needed after this mission to assemble the entire orbiting complex. The ISS will have a mass of 1 million pounds, be longer than a football field, and house up to seven astronauts and cosmonauts. The successful docking of Zarya and Unity demonstrates the capabilities of the shuttle's robot arm and the precision of the astronauts, paving the way for future construction and assembly of the space station. The assembly process will require significant resources and time, with the estimated completion date being several years away.

After an extravagant opening ceremony, the games went well despite a brief soccer brawl, a snooker game incident, the banning of Iran's equestrian team horses for not being disease free, and the withdrawal of Saudi Arabia over strained relations with Thailand. Thai police cleared the streets of beggars and criminals, and athletes were disciplined to avoid Bangkok's night life. China's recall of four soccer players from Europe is testimony of the importance of the games. The Asian Games scheduled for Bangkok Dec. 6-20, 1998 were never a sure thing. Thailand was in economic doldrums and there was question whether the sports complex for the games would be completed in time. By late October, however, it was clear the games could take place. Thai police rounded up beggars who might intimidate spectators, but then in late November Saudi Arabia withdrew its teams and there was concern that athletes might be tempted by Bangkok's nightlife and the availability of Viagra. But on Dec. 6 the games opened as scheduled as 6,000 athletes from 41 nations competed, including a heated snooker match between India and Pakistan. Despite economic problems and threats from the Asian Olympic Committee that it would move the games, Thailand was able to meet construction deadlines and open the 13th annual Asian Games to participants from 43 countries. The games have not been without controversy. In a surprise move, Saudi Arabia pulled its athletes from the games, probably in reprisal for a jewel theft and the murder of three of its diplomats. There was speculation that the Saudis would send a ceremonial delegation. National rivalries also were Apparent in a snooker game between India and Pakistan when an argument Arose following a disputed call. Bangkok prepared for the 6000 athletes from 41 nations to compete in the Asian Games. Thai police detained more than 300 beggars to make the city's streets safer, but its notorious night life concerned some team managers. China considered recalling overseas soccer players to bolster chances at the Games. Saudi Arabia abruptly withdrew its 105-man team citing the approach of Ramadan but more likely for past grievances with the Thais. Later, they considered sending a \"small team\". The Iranian equestrian team's horses failed the vet's exam. The Thai King opened the Games with an elaborate ceremony. Rivals India and Pakistan argued during a snooker match.", "response": "The 1998 Asian Games, held in Bangkok, Thailand, were a significant event that brought together over 10,000 athletes from 43 nations. The games were a proving ground for the 2000 Olympics in Sydney, Australia, and many countries sent reduced teams due to the Asian crisis. Thailand had won the host rights in 1995, but faced setbacks that led the Olympic Council of Asia to threaten to move the games to another country late last year. However, the tour of the nearly complete facilities, which was held for a delegation of heads of organizing committees, alleviated doubts, with Abdul Muttaleb al-Ahmad, director general of the Olympic Council of Asia, stating that \"everything is 99 percent completed\".\n\nThe preparations for the games were marred by controversy, with the decision to award the contract for the sports complex being met with criticism. Additionally, the country's worst economic downturn in decades raised doubts over Thailand's ability to host the games. However, the issue of liquidity problems at Bangkok Land, the company responsible for the housing estate, was resolved through the allocation of 200 million baht (approximately $5 million) worth of credit guarantees from a scrapped project. This allowed the construction of the sports complex to continue, with Santiparb Tejavanija, deputy secretary of the Bangkok Asian Games Organizing Committee, stating that the complex was 95 percent complete and expected to be finished by the end of the month.\n\nThe opening ceremony of the games was held on Sunday night, and it was attended by Thailand's king, Bhumibol Adulyadej. The ceremony began with a torch relay led by Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai, followed by a three-hour show featuring 7,614 performers, with a theme of \"Friendship Beyond Frontiers\". The king was upstaged by Japan's Naoko Takahashi, who won the games' first gold medal in the marathon. The ceremony also included a martial arts display celebrating Asian unity, and hundreds of primary school students introduced the games' mascot, \"Chai-yo.\"\n\nDespite the resolution of the liquidity issue, the withdrawal of Saudi Arabia from the games raised concerns about the strained relations between Thailand and Saudi Arabia. The Thai deputy prime minister and president of the Bangkok Asian Games Organizing Committee, Bhichai Rattakul, requested the Foreign Ministry to urge the Saudi government to reconsider its decision to withdraw its 105-strong team. The games were set to open on December 6, and Bhichai emphasized that sports should not be mixed with politics.\n\nIn conclusion, the 1998 Asian Games were a significant event that brought together athletes from 43 nations, despite the challenges faced by the organizers. The games were a proving ground for the 2000 Olympics, and many countries sent reduced teams due to the Asian crisis. The preparations for the games were marred by controversy, but the resolution of the liquidity issue allowed the construction of the sports complex to continue. The opening ceremony was a grand affair, and the games were a welcome distraction for the Thai people, who have been struggling with economic problems. However, the withdrawal of Saudi Arabia raised concerns about the strained relations between Thailand and Saudi Arabia, and the importance of being prepared for any unexpected issues was emphasized by the Olympic Council of Asia.

Three prominent leaders of the China Democratic Party were put to trial and sentenced to 11-, 12- and 13-year prison terms. Germany and the U.S. condemned the arrests. A labor rights activist was released and exiled to the U.S. to blunt any opposition to Communist rule. U.S. policy to encourage trade and diplomacy in hope of democratic reforms evidences failure, but the U.S. is continuing its policy of encouragement. Friends of jailed dissidents state that they will continue to campaign for change. The US trade-driven policy of expanded ties encouraging Chinese democracy is questioned. China signed rights treaties and dissidents used new laws to set up China Democracy Party, but China violates the new laws by persecuting dissidents. It regularly frees activists from prison then exiles them so they lose local influence. It arrested an activist trying to register a rights monitoring group. CP leader Jiang's hard-line speech and publicity for activists sentenced to long prison terms signals a renewed Chinese crackdown. A rights activist expected to be sacrificed in the cause of democracy. Germany called China's sentencing of dissidents unacceptable. After 2 years of wooing the West by signing international accords, apparently relaxing controls on free speech, and releasing and exiling three dissenters, China cracked down against political dissent in Dec 1998. Leaders of the China Democracy Party (CDP) were arrested and three were sentenced to jail terms of 11 to 13 years. The West, including the US, UK and Germany, reacted strongly. Clinton's China policy of engagement was questioned. China's Jiang Zemin stated economic reform is not a prelude to democracy and vowed to crush any challenges to the Communist Party or \"social stability\". The CDP vowed to keep working, as more leaders awaited arrest. Xu Wenli, Wang Youchai, and Qin Yongmin, leading dissidents and prominent members of the China Democracy Party, were found guilty of subversion and sentenced to 13, 11, and 12 years in prison, respectively. Soon after the sentencing, China's president, Jiang Zemin, delivered speeches in which he asserted that Western political system must not be adopted and vowed to crush challenges to Communist Party rule. The harsh sentences and speeches signal a crackdown on dissent, but Zha Jianguo, another Democracy Party leader, says he will continue to push for change. Western nations condemned the sentences as violations of U.N. rights treaties signed by China.", "response": "The human rights situation in China remains dire, with a growing number of secret detentions and closed-door trials, as described by Maya Wang, a Human Rights Watch researcher. The Chinese government's actions have been widely criticized by human rights groups, who argue that the country is violating its own laws and international human rights standards. Under President Xi Jinping's rule, minority groups have faced increased repression, with unconfirmed reports suggesting that hundreds of Muslim Uygurs and Kazakhs have been detained in political re-education centres. Tibetans also face strict travel restrictions and government surveillance, making it difficult for them to travel abroad.\n\nThe government's disregard for due process is evident in its treatment of political prisoners, who are often subjected to solitary confinement or harsh conditions locked up with hardened criminals. The China Democracy Party has been trying to establish itself in 14 provinces and cities, but authorities have responded by detaining or questioning at least 32 members. The party's appeal is evident in a petition signed by 205 dissidents calling for the immediate release of Xu and two other leaders.\n\nThe international community has condemned the arrests, with the United States expressing its concerns to the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs and urging the immediate release of Xu and Qin. However, Zhu criticized the United States for interfering in China's internal affairs, saying that there is \"absolutely no contradiction at all\" between China's support for international human rights treaties and its arrests of the two dissidents. China has signed several key U.N. treaties on civil and political rights, including one in October that guarantees freedom of expression and freedom of association. Despite this, U.N. human rights experts have called on Beijing to free Liu Xiaobo from prison, labeling his imprisonment as a severe violation of human rights. The move has sparked widespread condemnation from the international community, with many calling for China to respect the principles of freedom of expression and association.\n\nIn conclusion, the state of human rights in China remains a pressing concern, with the government's actions and responses from other countries indicating a continued crackdown on dissent and opposition. The international community must continue to speak out against China's human rights abuses and urge the government to respect its international obligations and commitments to human rights. As Maya Wang pointed out, the current repression is the worst since 1989's bloody crackdown on pro-democracy protests centred on Beijing's Tiananmen Square. It is imperative that China takes immediate action to address its human rights record and ensure the rights of its citizens are protected.

U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan met with Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi in a desert tent, where they discussed the possibility of bringing two suspects to trial for the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am airliner. Annan expressed optimism that an arrangement could be reached in the \"not too distant future\". The meeting was part of Annan's 15-hour diplomatic effort to convince Libya to hand over Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah, who are suspected of the bombing that killed 270 people. Annan is trying to get Libya to agree to a U.S.-British plan to try the two suspects before a panel of Scottish judges in the Netherlands.\nAnnan traveled to Libya on Saturday for a one-day visit to hold talks with Libyan officials, with the primary objective of negotiating the transfer of the two suspects to a Scottish court for trial. The Lockerbie bombing, which resulted in the deaths of 270 people, remains one of the deadliest terrorist attacks in history. Libya has been under U.N. sanctions since 1992 for its refusal to hand over the two alleged intelligence agents, Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah. They are accused by the United States and Britain of blowing up a Pan Am airliner over the Scottish village of Lockerbie on Dec. 21, 1988.\nA Libyan legal team has been meeting regularly with Annan's legal counsel to discuss a U.S.-British proposal to try the suspects in the Netherlands according to Scottish law and using Scottish judges. U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan arrived in Libya on Saturday for talks aimed at bringing to trial two Libyan suspects in the 1988 Pan Am bombing over Lockerbie, Scotland. Annan's one-day visit to meet with Libyan leader Col. Moammar Gadhafi followed reports in the Libyan media that Gadhafi had no authority to hand over the suspects. This position would indicate that Gadhafi is giving himself enough diplomatic room in the event he decides against giving up the suspects.\nAnnan expressed optimism that an arrangement could be secured in the \"not too distant future\" after a meeting with Gadhafi, which followed talks with Libyan Foreign Minister Omar al-Muntasser in Sirte. State-run Libyan Radio quoted an unnamed official as saying that \"a solution to this crisis is within reach,\" crediting Annan's talks with al-Muntasser. The UN sanctions have had a significant impact on Libya, and the country is eager to lift them. The efforts by the UN to persuade Libya to extradite the two suspects have been ongoing for several years, with Annan's diplomatic efforts being the latest attempt to resolve the issue. The trial of the two suspects in a Scottish court would be a significant step towards justice for the victims of the Pan Am 103 bombing. \n\nNote: The passage is within 500 words.

Ecevit, a former prime minister, was asked to form a new government. He was unable to win the support of Ciller for a secular coalition. Refusing any alliance with the Islamic Virtue Party, Ecevit turned to President Demirel to find another solution. Demirel was expected to turn to a widely trusted lawmaker to form Turkey's next government. New premier-designate Erez got backing from 2 key secular parties as he tried to form a broad-based secular coalition that would include some from the Virtue Party. Following charges that he interfered in a privatization contract and helped a businessman with mob ties, Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz was forced to resign. President Demeril asked Bulent Ecevit, former three-time prime minister from the 1970s and champion of Turkish Cypriot rights, to form a new government. After three weeks, Ecevit was unable to secure the support of the Center-Right Party. At issue was the participation of the Islamic Virtue Part in the secular government, Ecevit returned his mandate and Demeril named Valim Erez as prime minister designate. Erez was in talks with the Virtue Party over possible cabinet seats. Turkish PM Yilmaz was forced to step down due to mob ties and claims of state bank privatization tampering. President Demirel asked highly respected 3-time former PM Bulent Ecevit to form a new majority government. A split between parliament's center left and right is longstanding. Ecevit distrusted Yilmaz and Ciller but brought in Yilmaz's party and wooed Ciller's. She wouldn't join unless Islamic Virtue were included, which the secular parties resisted. After a 3-week effort, Ecevit gave up rather than include Virtue. Yalim Erez tried next and won the backing of 2 key secular parties. He will talk to Ciller and run Turkey until the April 18 election. For more than a month, Turkish politicians have been trying to form a new government. The last prime minister was voted out after charges of corruption and mob ties. Longtime politician and three-time prime minister, Ecevit, tried for two weeks to form a coalition, which would satisfy the staunchly secular military. He failed when he could not get the support of both center-right parties. The president then asked a member of Parliament to form an interim coalition government to serve until the April election. Erez attained center-right support if he sticks to secular principles, but he may be forced to give some Cabinet seats to the Islamic Virtue Party.", "response": "The current political situation in Turkey is marked by division and polarization, with the center-left and center-right parties being at odds with each other. The previous government, led by Yilmaz, collapsed in November amid allegations of ties to organized crime and interference with the sale of a state bank. This led to a snap election, which was initially scheduled for November 2019 but was brought forward to June 2018 by President Erdogan. The election is part of Erdogan's efforts to consolidate power and implement his vision for a new Turkey, which includes shifting the balance of power towards the presidency. This move has sparked concerns among opposition parties and civil society groups, who fear that it will lead to authoritarianism and undermine democratic institutions in Turkey.\n\nThe current government is led by President Erdogan, who has been accused of undermining democratic institutions and consolidating power. The proposed changes to the political system, which aim to increase the powers of the presidency, have been met with resistance from the military, which fears that it will lead to an Islamic-led government. The military has a history of intervening in politics, having pressured the only previous Islamic-led government out of power for failing to adhere to the country's secular traditions.\n\nThe snap election has been seen as a way for Erdogan to implement his vision for a new Turkey, which includes a stronger presidency and a more centralized government. However, the election has also been criticized for being rushed and lacking transparency. The military commanders have expressed concerns that the election will produce a Parliament just as divided as the present one, and have quietly told senior political figures that they do not want a quick election.\n\nThe implications of the snap election and the proposed changes to the political system are significant, and have sparked concerns among opposition parties and civil society groups. The new system, which would give the president more powers, has been criticized for being authoritarian and undermining democratic institutions in Turkey. The international community has also been watching the situation closely, with many expressing concerns about the erosion of democratic institutions in Turkey.\n\nIn conclusion, the current political situation in Turkey is marked by division and polarization, with the center-left and center-right parties being at odds with each other. The previous government collapsed amid allegations of wrongdoing, leading to a snap election that has been criticized for being rushed and lacking transparency. The proposed changes to the political system, which aim to increase the powers of the presidency, have been met with resistance from the military and opposition parties, who fear that it will lead to authoritarianism and undermine democratic institutions in Turkey.

The remark fit Sharon's long history of unyielding bellicosity towards Palestine. When he was appointed some thought that Netanyahu was placating Israel's far right wing while striving for peace. Others saw it as a move to scuttle the peace effort. Arab commentary deemed the appointment \"tantamount to disaster\" and \"the bullet of mercy\" to the peace process. Peace talks in the U.S. were in the offing with the outcome in doubt. Appointment of Ariel Sharon as Foreign Minister by PM Netanyahu does not bode well for the peace process. His appointment is surprising in that the two have differed on withdrawal from Palestinian territory and is seen as an effort to placate the right. Sharon, 70, is an unapologetic warrior on the battlefield and in partisan politics. He brings heavy baggage: right-wing intransigence and responsibility for failing to prevent the killings of 460 unarmed Palestinians in refugee camps during the Lebanon incursion. Sharon has said that he will not shake Arafat's hand and his appointment is seen as a \"bullet of mercy\" for the Middle East peace process. Ariel Sharon was named Israeli foreign minister just weeks before a scheduled peace summit in the US, aimed at negotiating an Israeli withdrawal from 13% of the West Bank. Arabs reacted strongly and said the hard-line, right-wing, warrior and former defense minister would kill any progress for a settlement in the mid-East. Many blame Sharon for a 1982 massacre of Palestinian civilians at refugee camps in Lebanon. Others believed his appointment was an effort to placate the far right and gain their support for the Netanyahu government and the concessions necessary for the peace process. Sharon vowed not to shake Yasser Arafat's hand. In a move widely viewed as an effort to placate the far right as he moves to withdraw from more West Bank land, Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu named hardliner Ariel Sharon foreign minister and chief peace negotiator. Sharon, a military leader with legendary victories in the 1967 and 1973 Mideast wars, is infamous in the Arab world as the defense minister in the 1982 invasion of Lebanon during which Lebanese Christian militiamen, Israeli allies, slaughtered hundreds of unarmed Palestinians. His appointment as lead negotiator was denounced as a \"disaster\" in the Lebanese press and \"a bullet of mercy to the peace process\" in a Syrian paper.", "response": "The appointment of Ariel Sharon as Foreign Minister by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in 1998 was a significant move that raised concerns about the Israeli-Palestinian peace process. Sharon's past actions, particularly his role in Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon, had made him a contentious figure in the Arab world. The international community was watching closely to see how Sharon's appointment would affect the already fragile peace process. As the new head of Israel's negotiations with the Palestinians, Sharon's hardline stance was likely to exacerbate tensions and hinder progress. The Syrian-Israeli peace talks, which had broken off over two years ago, were unlikely to resume anytime soon. Lebanon's peace talks with Israel had also been suspended pending progress in Syrian-Israeli negotiations.\n\nThe reaction of the Arab community to Sharon's appointment was one of skepticism and criticism. Many Arabs were familiar with Sharon's role in the 1982 invasion of Lebanon and his indirect responsibility for the massacre of hundreds of Palestinian refugees. The appointment had been seen as a clear message from Netanyahu that Israel would not change its anti-peace stance. Saeb Erekat, a lead negotiator for the Palestinians, viewed the appointment as a sign that Netanyahu was prioritizing his relationship with the right-wing over the peace process. Erekat believed that Netanyahu was trying to \"make peace with the right wing at the expense of making peace with us\".\n\nThe appointment of Sharon as Foreign Minister had significant implications for the Middle East peace process. As the head of Israel's negotiations with the Palestinians, Sharon's hardline stance was likely to hinder progress and exacerbate tensions. The international community was watching closely to see how Sharon's appointment would affect the peace process, and many were concerned about Israel's commitment to the process. The appointment had raised concerns about Israel's willingness to make concessions, and many Arabs viewed Sharon as a hard-liner who was unlikely to make progress.

In September the U.S. initiated legal action against a Sudanese arrested in Germany and in November charges were prepared against six men including bin Laden. The U.S. had, in support of its case, documentary evidence and a cooperative former senior aide of bin Laden. Meanwhile, authorities reported bin Laden agents active in Bangladesh and the Balkans and the Taliban government of Afghanistan proclaimed bin Laden \"a man without sin. Evidence shows Sudanese factory bombed by US is linked to bin Laden. US prosecutors ask for an extension to extradite a bin Laden lieutenant. FBI questions witnesses of Nairobi embassy blast, preparing for trial of 6 suspects. The Taliban says the US is using bin Laden as an excuse to attack Afghanistan. Goal of US August raid there was to kill bin Laden and his aides. The Taliban declares bin Laden a free man, with no proof of anti-US terror. 2 arrested for articles inciting Taliban-style revolt in Bangladesh. Bin Laden cell is in Albania and elsewhere in Europe. Bin Laden aide informs for the US. East African bin Laden cell has security woes in '97. In the aftermath of the almost simultaneous bombings of U.S. embassies in East Africa, much has been learned of the terrorist network put together and financed by Saudi billionaire Osama bin Laden. Osama bin Laden, the mastermind of the bombings and U.S. cruise missile attack against a supposed terrorist camp in Afghanistan shortly after the bombings was an attempt not only to disrupt the terrorist network but to get bin Laden himself. As the investigation into the bombings continues, more is being learned from seized computers and top aides turned informants. Bin Laden remains in Afghanistan by permission of the Taliban. Following the bombings of the embassies in Africa, the US began a full-scale assault on Osama bin Laden. Attacked were a chemical plant in the Sudan and a camp in Afghanistan where he was believed to be, creating an assassination opportunity. Evidence was gathered from a captured computer and an in-law who defected. Suspects were identified and the FBI began to build a case in New York. Extradition of a suspect from Germany was sought. Reactions from Islamic nations varied: Afghanistan promised him safe haven; more liberal Bandladesh arrested pro-Taliban reporters; Albania feared it was an infiltration center for the rest of Europe, including Kosovo.", "response": "The US government's actions following the August 1998 bombings of the US embassies in East Africa were swift and decisive. After the bombings, President Bill Clinton authorized cruise missile strikes against Osama bin Laden's compound in Afghanistan. This move was a direct response to the threat posed by bin Laden's organization, which had been a concern for the Clinton administration even before the bombings. The review of the legal justification for military attacks against a terrorist leadership, which was conducted by the White House, provided the necessary legal basis for the operation. The review was seen as a precedent for future operations in similar circumstances and sparked intense debate over the years about the interpretation of the 1976 executive order.\n\nThe investigation into the embassy attacks was ongoing, with the FBI fanning out around the world to look into the attacks. The government aimed to identify, locate, and prosecute all those responsible for the embassy attacks, from those who constructed and delivered the bombs to those who paid for them and ordered it done. The United States had blamed bin Laden's group, al Qaeda, for the August 7 bombings of US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, which killed 224 people, including 12 Americans. In response, the United States fired Tomahawk cruise missiles at suspected bin Laden training camps in eastern Afghanistan.\n\nA secret review conducted by White House lawyers in the months prior to the attack concluded that such operations are legal under US and international law. The raid was timed to coincide with a meeting between bin Laden and his chief operatives, with over 70 cruise missiles striking the camps. A federal grand jury in Manhattan indicted Osama bin Laden on 238 counts of conspiring to bomb two US embassies in Africa in August and committing acts of terrorism against Americans abroad. The government immediately announced two rewards of $5 million each for information leading to the arrest or conviction of bin Laden and Muhammad Atef, his chief military commander.\n\nThe US government's actions following the operation were widely praised for their precision and bravery, with many considering it a major victory in the war on terror. The mission marked a significant milestone in the decade-long hunt for bin Laden, who was responsible for the 9/11 attacks and numerous other terrorist atrocities. The operation was also seen as a precedent for future operations in similar circumstances, and it sparked intense debate over the years about the interpretation of the 1976 executive order. The review of the mission to ensure that all necessary precautions were taken to avoid civilian casualties and to verify the identity of the individual killed was also conducted. DNA analysis confirmed that the body was indeed that of Osama bin Laden. The initial cost of developing a special operations unit in Libya was estimated at about $6.2 million, and the details such as the size, mission, and composition of the forces were still being finalized. However, the US has been involved in counterterrorism efforts in Africa for a long time, and they have been willing to take action to address perceived threats.  The US government's knowledge of bin Laden's activities stems in part from the cooperation of an informant who worked for bin Laden, transporting weapons and explosives and assisting in running his finances. The investigation of bin Laden is ongoing, with the FBI fanning out around the world to look into the embassy attacks. The government aims to identify, locate, and prosecute all those responsible for the embassy attacks, from those who constructed and delivered the bombs to those who paid for them and ordered it done.
