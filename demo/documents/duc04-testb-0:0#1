She declined to give details on what evidence was being sought from Kopp, citing a sealed affidavit that would compromise the ongoing investigation. O'Donnell explained that federal law allows for an arrest warrant for a material witness when a person has information that is important to a case. If Kopp is found, he would be arrested, brought to Buffalo, and ordered to provide the required evidence, after which he would likely be released."}
