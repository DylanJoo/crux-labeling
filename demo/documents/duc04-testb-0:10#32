Long hours and limits on fees paid by the public health-care system are causing burnout and deterring medical school graduates. Few Canadian medical schools offer training in abortion, and women in rural areas often face long journeys to access abortion services. Abortion-rights groups say the situation would improve if the RU-486 abortion pill were available in Canada, but no drug company has applied for permission to market the pill due to fears of boycotts or doubts about profitability."}
