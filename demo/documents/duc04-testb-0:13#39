One friend, Kenny, recalled how Kopp would often talk about the evils of abortion and how he wanted to become a Catholic priest. Despite his strong convictions, Kopp was known to be a peaceful protestor who never resorted to violence. Both Kopp and fellow anti-abortion activist Weslin have been arrested multiple times during protests, and the two men have moved in the same circles, attending the same events and even sharing a jail cell in Atlanta in 1988."}
