The current resident of the house, E. Kenny, remembered Kopp as a \"really nice guy\" who did chores around the house but was focused on the anti-abortion movement. Kopp's involvement in the movement has been described as intense, with some investigators believing that he may be part of a hard-core group of protesters who are willing to use violence to achieve their goals. The FBI is seeking Kopp as a material witness in the Slepian case, but he has not been arrested or charged with any violent acts."}
