{"id": "duc04-testb-0:17#53", "contents": "The FBI's approach to investigating extremist groups is guided by domestic security guidelines, which require a \"reasonable indication\" of a group's intention to break the law before an inquiry can be opened. However, the agency has also been quietly evaluating the threat posed by various extremist groups through informal interviews and links with local authorities. Many of these groups are considered to pose little real danger, while lone terrorists, who are often inflamed by extremist ideology but unaffiliated with any group, are more difficult to investigate. The case of Eric Robert Rudolph, wanted for bombings at the Atlanta Olympics and abortion clinics, illustrates the challenge of tracking lone terrorists who operate \"off the grid\" without ties to family, friends, or work."}
