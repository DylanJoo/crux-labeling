{"id": "duc04-testb-0:18#56", "contents": "The announcement that law enforcement officials are looking for Kopp has been made as Attorney General Janet Reno prepares to revive an interagency task force to look once again for possible conspiracies behind anti-abortion crimes. Kopp's car was seen near the home of Dr. Barnett A. Slepian, who was killed in a sniper attack on October 23, but he is not currently a suspect in the attack. Law enforcement officials are pursuing many tips, including about 400 that have poured into the FBI's information line, and are reviewing hundreds of hours of videotapes of demonstrations in search of Kopp's face. The police consider the shooting of Slepian to be connected to three attacks in Canada and one in Rochester on doctors who provide abortions."}
