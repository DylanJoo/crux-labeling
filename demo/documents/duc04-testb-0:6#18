His academic career was unremarkable, attending a local community college before transferring to the University of Denver, where he majored in zoology. After being rejected by medical schools in the United States, he spent a year studying in Belgium and then enrolled at the Autonomous University for Medicine in Guadalajara, Mexico. His friends remembered him as a funny and obstinate person who was determined to achieve his goals. Richard Schwarz, an old classmate, recalled that Slepian had strong beliefs and would say, \"Go after what's yours and what's right.\" This determination was evident in various aspects of his life, including his decision to go to the top of the World Trade Center despite his fear of heights."}
