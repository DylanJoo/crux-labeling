He tried to engage his critics through the local newspaper, suggesting that they should focus on helping women avoid unwanted pregnancies through birth control and counseling. He also warned that the repeated personal attacks were inciting violence. Slepian accepted that his opponents acted out of moral conviction, but resented the personal attacks, which he believed tended to demonize and dehumanize him and increased the danger. Despite the risks, Slepian began to stop and chat with protesters he recognized outside the Womenservices abortion clinic in Buffalo, where he worked two days a week. He even surprised a gathering of protesters by inviting the protest's organizer, the Rev. Robert Behn, to breakfast."}
