{"id": "duc04-testb-10:0#0", "contents": "On Thursday, just before midnight, a fire broke out in a dance hall in Sweden's second-largest city, Gothenburg, killing 65 people and injuring 157 others. The fire spread rapidly, gutting the building and leaving rescuers with a horrific scene likened to a \"gas chamber\" by local rescue service leader Lennart Olin. The cause of the fire remains unknown, but officials stated that the building did not have sprinklers and was not required to have them. The dance, attended mostly by immigrants or children of immigrants, had an estimated 400 people in attendance, despite the facility's maximum capacity of 150."}
