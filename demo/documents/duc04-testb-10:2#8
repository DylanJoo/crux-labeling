Mourners had laid a 30-meter-long pile of bouquets, candles, and cards of remembrance in the parking lot. The cards' inscriptions were brief, and the people who stood reading them also had few words. Many of those injured in the blaze may have to endure shocked looks for the rest of their lives, as authorities say the explosive fire quickly raised the temperature in the hall to 600 degrees. The hall was packed far beyond its capacity, licensed to hold a maximum of 150, but holding at least 250 and perhaps as many as 400 when the fire hit."}
