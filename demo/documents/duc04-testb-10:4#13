{"id": "duc04-testb-10:4#13", "contents": "The fire broke out at around midnight in the building of the local Macedonian Association, where a dance was being held for 13 to 18-year-olds celebrating Halloween and a holiday weekend. About 300 or 400 people were inside, and many escaped on their own. However, police rescued 40 people and recovered 59 bodies, with the 60th victim dying at a hospital. The cause of the fire was not immediately known, but there were signs that it may have been set. The fact that the fire spread so fast indicated that it was not a normal fire, according to Olin."}
