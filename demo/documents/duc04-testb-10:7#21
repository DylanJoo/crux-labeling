The two-story building, which was jammed with teenagers, was completely gutted by the fast-spreading flames. Rescue services leader Lennart Olin described the scene as resembling a \"gas chamber.\" The dance hall had a maximum capacity of 150 people, but an estimated 400 people, mostly aged 13 to 18, were in attendance. The fire was the deadliest in modern Swedish history since 1978."}
