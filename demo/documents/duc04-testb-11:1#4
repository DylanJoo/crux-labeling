China claims Taiwan as a breakaway province and argues that only sovereign nations are allowed to send their heads of state. This has led to a compromise, where Taiwan sends a representative instead of its president. The APEC forum groups 18 economies, including Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, and the United States."}
