The organization also hopes to complete a plan to lift trade barriers in nine key industries, including environmental products and services, energy, and telecommunications. APEC, which accounts for half of all global trade, consists of 21 member countries, including the United States, Australia, Canada, China, and Japan, among others. The organization will also include three new members: Russia, Vietnam, and Peru. According to John S. Wolf, the U.S. ambassador for APEC, the summit provides an opportunity for members to work together and develop a sense of what's possible in addressing the financial crisis."}
