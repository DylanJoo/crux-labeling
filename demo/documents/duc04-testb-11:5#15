Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, 72, had previously stated that he could \"drop dead\" at any time, but due to the large number of candidates for the deputy's job within the ruling United Malays National Organization, a decision was not expected quickly. The party leaders also planned to confer on what to do now that the High Court judge has banned all comments on Anwar's guilt or innocence."}
