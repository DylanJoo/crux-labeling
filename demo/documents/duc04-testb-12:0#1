It will also monitor arriving passengers and cargo, and can keep travelers or goods out if it considers them a danger to Israeli security. Despite these limitations, the airport is expected to provide a boost to the troubled Palestinian economy, permitting the export of Palestinian flowers and farm produce that were previously shipped out via Israel with difficulties and delays."}
