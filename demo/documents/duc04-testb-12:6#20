Yarkoni conveyed the message to Palestinian Civil Aviation Authority Chairman Brig. Gen. Fayez Zeidan in a letter sent on Monday. Zeidan was not immediately available for comment. The potential closure of the airport could further undermine the already fragile peace process. The airport's operation has been a point of contention between Israel and the Palestinians, with Israel seeking to maintain security control and the Palestinians pushing for greater autonomy."}
