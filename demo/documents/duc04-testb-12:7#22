However, a deal was finally reached, and the airport protocol was signed last week as part of the Wye River land-for-security agreement between Israel and the Palestinians. Under the agreement, Israel will have a say in who and what enters Gaza, but its monitors will operate discreetly behind one-way mirrors, as they do at other crossings into autonomous Palestinian areas. Tomer Degani, a spokesman for the Israeli military government in Gaza, stated that periodic security closures would not affect the airport's operation."}
