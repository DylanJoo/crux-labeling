{"id": "duc04-testb-13:1#3", "contents": "Iran's equestrian team will not be able to compete in the upcoming Asian Games with their own horses due to non-compliance with the veterinary commission's requirements. The three horses, which were originally from Iran but had been training in the United States, did not possess the necessary health certificates to guarantee they are disease-free. This is a result of the team's lack of awareness of the rules, according to Siraya Chunekamrai, president of the Veterinary Commission for the games."}
