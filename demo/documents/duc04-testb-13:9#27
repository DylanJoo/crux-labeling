The Thai deputy prime minister and president of the Bangkok Asian Games Organizing Committee, Bhichai Rattakul, has requested the Foreign Ministry to urge the Saudi government to reconsider its decision to withdraw its 105-strong team. The games are set to open on December 6. Bhichai emphasized that sports should not be mixed with politics, and it is unclear whether the withdrawal is related to the Saudi jewel scandal or other factors."}
