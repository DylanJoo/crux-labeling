However, suspicion has arisen that the real reason is the continued strain in relations between Thailand and Saudi Arabia since a Thai janitor stole precious jewelry from the palace of a Saudi prince in 1989. The jewels were recovered and returned, but many were found to be fake, leading the Saudis to believe that corrupt officers and members of Thailand's power elite kept the loot. The real jewels have never been recovered, and tensions were further aggravated by the murder of three Saudi diplomats in Bangkok in 1990 and 1991."}
