Serbian police and the Yugoslav army have routed separatist Kosovo Albanian rebels in the crackdown that began in late February. Kosovo is in southern Serbia, the main republic of Yugoslavia. To avoid NATO airstrikes, Yugoslavia must end hostilities, withdraw army and security forces, address the humanitarian crisis, and ensure refugees can return home. Russia is against using NATO force in Kosovo but warns that airstrikes could occur if decisive measures are not taken to improve the situation."}
