Despite the tension, an American diplomat familiar with the themes Holbrooke planned to stress to Milosevic said that there was no expectation of an agreement. Instead, the goal was to make explicit what was expected of Milosevic. The essence of Holbrooke's demands centered on issues outlined in a United Nations Security Council resolution, which ordered Milosevic to withdraw extra army and police forces from Kosovo and to send back military forces to their bases."}
