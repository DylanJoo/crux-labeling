He has mined the borders with Macedonia and Albania, limiting the flow of refugees and arms supplies to the rebels. This has been a key concern for Washington, which has feared that the conflict could spill over into neighboring countries and draw in Albania and the ethnic Albanian population in Macedonia. Milosevic's actions have been carefully calibrated to avoid triggering a wider conflict, and he has even made token gestures towards diplomacy, such as meeting with Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova in May. However, these efforts have been largely superficial, and the violence has continued unabated."}
