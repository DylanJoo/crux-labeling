Elizabeth Birch, executive director of the Human Rights Campaign, hopes that Shepard's death will bring about a deeper understanding of hate crime laws and lead to an awakening in Wyoming and the United States Congress. According to the Southern Poverty Law Center, 21 men and women were killed in the United States in 1996 because of their sexual orientation, and the FBI reported that sexual orientation was a factor in 11.6% of the 8,759 hate crimes recorded that year."}
