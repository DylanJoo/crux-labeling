The attack occurred on October 6, and Shepard was discovered 18 hours later, still alive but severely injured. He was taken to a hospital in Fort Collins, Colorado, where he remained in a coma until his death on October 12. The incident sparked widespread outrage and shock, with many people expressing their condolences and support for Shepard's family. A college homecoming parade in Fort Collins, which took place just a few blocks from the hospital, featured a fraternity float with a scarecrow labeled \"I'm Gay,\" which was seen as a disturbing and insensitive gesture."}
