President Clinton condemned the attack, saying, \"I was deeply grieved by the act of violence perpetrated against Matthew Shepard.\" Clinton urged Congress to pass the federal Hate Crimes Prevention Act, saying, \"There is nothing more important to the future of this country than our standing together against intolerance, prejudice, and violent bigotry.\" Wyoming is one of 10 states that does not have a hate crime law. Shepard's parents, Dennis and Judy Shepard, released a statement from Fort Collins thanking \"the American public for their kind thoughts about Matthew.\" They described their son as a \"trusting person who takes everybody at face value and does not see the bad side of anyone.\""}
