Rev. Royce Brown, the pastor of St. Mark's, delivered a eulogy that drew a powerful parallel between Shepard's suffering and the crucifixion of Jesus Christ. The service was a celebration of Shepard's life, his dreams of working for human rights, and the impact he has had on the nation. His death has sparked a wave of candlelight vigils, rallies, and statements of support from President Clinton and Congress."}
