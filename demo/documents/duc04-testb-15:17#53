In the last two decades, 21 states and the District of Columbia have passed laws that increase penalties for crimes committed because of a person's race, religion, color, national origin, and sexual orientation. However, 19 states, including Colorado, do not include sexual orientation in their hate-crime laws, and 10 states, including Wyoming, have no hate-crime laws at all. President Clinton has urged Congress to pass the federal Hate Crimes Protection Act, which would make federal offenses of crimes based on a person's sexual orientation."}
