The ads, which feature alleged former homosexuals who claim to have \"changed\" through the power of Jesus Christ, are part of a six-month campaign by the religious right to demonize gay people for political gain in this election year. The ads are being broadcast on TV at great expense, and are being trumpeted in Washington to ensure free national exposure, just three weeks before Election Day."}
