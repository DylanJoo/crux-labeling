Fresh flowers filled the red brick church where Matt had been baptized as a teenager and had served as an Episcopal acolyte. Rev. Royce Brown, the pastor of St. Mark's, delivered a eulogy that replaced the image of Matt on the fence with that of another man hung upon a cross, finding solace in the symbolism. Matt's dream of working for human rights had been cut short, but his death had sparked a national movement to guarantee physical safety for gay people."}
