{"id": "duc04-testb-16:11#35", "contents": "The outcome of the Senate races could have significant implications for the impeachment process. Of the 34 Senate seats in play, 18 are held by Democrats and 16 by Republicans. Republicans would need to win 28 of the 34 races to produce the 67 votes necessary for conviction, assuming a party-line vote. While this seems unlikely, analysts are watching to see if Senate candidates will begin to make explicit appeals for votes based on their potential vote on a presidential impeachment. Jennifer Duffy, who follows Senate races for the Cook Political Report, noted that so far, none of the candidates have made such an appeal, but wondered if this may change in the future."}
