D'Amato for his efforts in securing health coverage for hundreds of thousands of uninsured children. This led to speculation that Rivera's union might endorse D'Amato or remain neutral in the U.S. Senate race in New York. However, on Monday, the 150,000-member union endorsed Rep. Charles E. Schumer, D-N.Y., which could potentially anger the powerful senator and make him less responsive to labor's needs in the future."}
