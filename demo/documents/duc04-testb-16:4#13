It would also be a blow to Schumer's efforts to portray D'Amato as a right-wing extremist and could signify a fraying of the traditional Democratic coalition. The endorsement would carry significant weight among gay and lesbian voters, who hold the Human Rights Campaign in high regard. The group's decision is being closely watched due to the importance of the New York Senate race to Democrats, who see defeating D'Amato as a crucial opportunity to prevent Republicans from gaining 60 seats in the Senate."}
