Democrats and advocates in both parties who support rights for gay people have been making personal appeals to Human Rights Campaign officials, urging them not to endorse D'Amato. Vice President Al Gore, Hillary Rodham Clinton, and Secretary for Health and Human Services Donna Shalala have reportedly made such appeals, although White House officials claim they do not know whether this is the case. Schumer met privately with the group's top officials last week to make one last pitch for the endorsement. Meanwhile, Clinton administration officials have been buttonholing the group's board members at every opportunity, from cocktail parties to fund-raisers, raising concerns about a D'Amato endorsement."}
