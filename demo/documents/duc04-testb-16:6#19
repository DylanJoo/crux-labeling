Many contributors and board members fear that endorsing D'Amato would alienate abortion rights supporters, who would quit the group in large numbers due to D'Amato's long-standing opposition to abortion. Additionally, New York gay activists would be deeply upset by an endorsement, citing D'Amato's role in installing the state Senate majority leader, Joseph Bruno, whom they consider to be strongly anti-gay."}
