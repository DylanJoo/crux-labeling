Two such candidates, Representative David Price of North Carolina and Representative Julia Carson of Indiana, have expressed discomfort with the idea of Clinton campaigning in their districts. When asked if they would want Clinton to visit, both paused and gave non-committal answers. Mrs. Carson said it would be impossible to schedule a visit at this late date, while Price stated that he didn't think it would be a good idea, despite welcoming Erskine Bowles, the president's chief of staff, to campaign with him."}
