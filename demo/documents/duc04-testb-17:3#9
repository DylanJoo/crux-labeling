The Islamic militant group Hamas claimed responsibility for the attack, which was intended to disrupt the peace agreement. In response, the Israeli cabinet suspended ratification of the Wye agreement until the Palestinian authority can demonstrate its commitment to fighting terrorism. The Cabinet also announced plans to begin building houses in the controversial Jewish settlement of Har Homa in east Jerusalem, a move that had been put on hold by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in an effort to facilitate negotiations with the Palestinians."}
