Palestinian Justice Minister Freih Abu-Medein accused Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of using the blast as a pretext for delaying implementation of the peace accord. Under the accord, Israel is to hand over another 13 percent of the territory in the West Bank to the Palestinians in exchange for various security steps. Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai predicts that the Israeli Cabinet will ratify the agreement in coming days."}
