Addressing a crowd of supporters in Jerusalem, Netanyahu stated, \"We will build also in Har Homa as we will build in every part of Jerusalem. By 2000, there will be homes at Har Homa.\" Har Homa has been a point of contention, with Palestinians seeking to establish it as the capital of their proposed independent state. The site has previously sparked angry protests and a breakdown in peace talks in March 1997."}
