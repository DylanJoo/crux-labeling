{"id": "duc04-testb-17:7#21", "contents": "At Jerusalem's Mahane Yehuda market, a devastating scene unfolded on Friday when an explosives-rigged car blew up, killing two people and injuring at least 21 others. The blast occurred just meters from the site of a previous suicide bombing 16 months prior. Blood and soot-blackened water ran through the streets, and a policeman attempted to cover a bloodied corpse with nearby materials. Police barricades were set up along Jerusalem's busiest thoroughfare, with soldiers and police holding back crowds of frantic onlookers, many of whom were searching for loved ones who had been shopping in the market just hours before the start of the Jewish Sabbath."}
