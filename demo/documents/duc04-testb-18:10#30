The point of contention is whether the president's actions warrant impeachment, with some arguing that the proven offenses are not impeachable, while others claim that the impeachable offenses have not been proven. Rep. Christopher Shays of Connecticut, one of the few Republican moderates who has not broken against the president, expressed his reasoning for not supporting impeachment, citing the lack of proof of impeachable offenses and the sincerity of arguments from both sides of the aisle."}
