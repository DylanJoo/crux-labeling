Bob Livingston from his role as future speaker of the House. The editorial highlighted the unexpected sideshow of Livingston's downfall and its implications on the struggle over President Clinton's future. Analysts on both sides will point to Livingston's resignation as evidence of a breakdown in legislative civility on Capitol Hill. While Democrats may see a moral symmetry in Livingston's downfall, the editorial cautions against using his resignation as a model for resolving the crisis at the White House."}
