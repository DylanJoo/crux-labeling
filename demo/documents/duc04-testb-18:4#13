{"id": "duc04-testb-18:4#13", "contents": "The television coverage of the impeachment debate was marked by a sense of history and decorum, with the House cameras providing a stately and dignified view of the proceedings. However, this sense of gravitas was not maintained by all the networks, with CBS opting to leave the news coverage at noon to broadcast a football game. The decision was widely criticized, and Dan Rather was forced to break in with updates from Washington during the game. The other networks and cable channels continued to provide comprehensive coverage of the debate and the vote, with many using split screens to show the tally of the electronically-cast vote and the reactions of the members of Congress."}
