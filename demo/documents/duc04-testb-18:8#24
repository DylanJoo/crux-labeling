{"id": "duc04-testb-18:8#24", "contents": "On Saturday, the House of Representatives voted to impeach President William Jefferson Clinton for perjury, paving the way for a trial in the Senate. The House rejected a last-minute Democratic attempt to soften its action to censure, instead calling on the Senate to try, convict, and remove Clinton from office. The vote was 228-206 in favor of the first article of impeachment, which accused Clinton of committing perjury before a federal grand jury. This move sets the stage for only the second impeachment of a president in the 209-year history of the Republic, with Clinton facing trial in the Senate on whether he should be removed from office."}
