On Wednesday, the astronauts were tasked with carrying the suitcase-size antennas to the middle of Unity and installing them on opposite sides of the 36-foot cylinder. Additional tasks included setting up a sunshade over a computer mounted on the outside of Unity. The electronic and computer connections for the antennas would be made inside Unity on Thursday, after the crew entered the orbiting station for the first time."}
