The Russian-built Zarya control module and the American-made Unity chamber were joined together for the first time, marking a historic moment in the construction of the orbiting complex. Commander Robert Cabana announced the capture of Zarya, and Mission Control congratulated the crew on a \"perfect and, hopefully, long-lasting fit.\" The 240-mile-high construction job began with Nancy Currie's capture of Zarya using the shuttle robot arm, followed by the challenging task of stacking the two giant cylinders in the cargo bay."}
