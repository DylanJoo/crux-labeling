It will provide all the necessary electricity and steering for the fledgling space station until a permanent control module can be launched next summer. The 36-foot, 25,000-pound Unity will serve as a connecting passageway, or vestibule, for future modules. In case Zarya and Unity could not be connected with the robot arm, two spacewalking astronauts would have to manually fit them together. The astronauts would be going out anyway Monday to attach electrical connectors and cables between the two components."}
