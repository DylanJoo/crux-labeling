{"id": "duc04-testb-1:10#30", "contents": "Despite modest encouragement over a new proposal delivered by the players to the owners, the National Basketball Association (NBA) canceled the first two weeks of the regular season, marking the first time in the league's 51-year history that games will be lost to a labor dispute. The cancellation, announced by NBA Deputy Commissioner Russ Granik, affects 99 games between November 3 and November 16. The decision came after nearly three and a half hours of meetings at a Manhattan hotel, where the players association proposed a tax system instead of a hard salary cap, a proposal the owners agreed to respond to by Friday."}
