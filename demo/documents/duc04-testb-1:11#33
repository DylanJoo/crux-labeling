{"id": "duc04-testb-1:11#33", "contents": "The National Basketball Players Association (NBPA) has proposed a luxury tax system that would penalize teams for exceeding a certain percentage of revenue on player salaries. According to Jeffrey Kessler, the chief outside counsel for the union, the proposal is designed to discourage teams like the Chicago Bulls from re-signing high-priced players like Michael Jordan. The luxury tax would be triggered if the league pays out more than 63 percent of revenues in salary, and would result in a reduction of the salary cap the following year. For example, if the league pays out $29 million over the salary cap, the salary cap would be reduced by $1 million the next season. However, the players would be assured that the salary cap would increase by at least $2 million before the credit takes effect."}
