The union's executive director, Billy Hunter, and players Patrick Ewing, Herb Williams, and Dikembe Mutombo attended the meeting. Although no owners were present, the league's lawyers and Commissioner David Stern spent most of the day explaining the proposal. The meeting was not without tension, as Stern and Hunter raised their voices at one point, but they were seen shaking hands and laughing after the meeting concluded. Hunter described the meeting as a chance for both sides to \"take the gloves off\" and \"vent\" their frustrations."}
