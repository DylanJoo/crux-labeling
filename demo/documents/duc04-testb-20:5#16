Zha maintains that such tactics are unnecessary. In its manifestoes, the Democracy Party espoused peaceful means to target \"the undemocratic system, not the political power of the Communist Party.\" \"We believe elections held after the establishment of a democratic system should decide who has the power,\" said Zha.
