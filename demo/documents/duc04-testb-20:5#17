All had proven track records, Xu and Qin as dissident editors in the Democracy Wall era movement 20 years ago, Wang as a student leader of the Tiananmen Square democracy demonstrations in 1989. \"But from another aspect, this has strengthened the resolve of even more party members to struggle on,\" Zha said of the arrests. Zha got interested in politics as a radical youth, following Mao Tse-tung's appeals to go to the countryside in 1968. When he returned to Beijing in 1989, he marched in the Tiananmen protests and continued his activism."}
