Two more crew from the Winston Churchill were plucked from a second liferaft late Monday night, but three others who had been aboard the liferaft were still missing. The two dead, both Australians, were found on the 40-foot vessel Business Post Naiad, about 100 kilometers (60 miles) off the New South Wales state town of Merimbula. The yacht's owner-skipper Bruce Guy and first-time race participant Phil Skeggs were killed. Guy suffered a heart attack during one of the two occasions the yacht rolled while Skeggs drowned when he was unable to free himself from a safety harness."}
