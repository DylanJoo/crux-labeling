{"id": "duc04-testb-21:3#10", "contents": "The three leaders covered 105 nautical miles in the first 7 1-2 hours of the race, propelled for the most part by favorable northerly breezes. The leaders rocketed along at an average speed of 14 knots in the first part of the 630-nautical-mile race to Hobart on the island state of Tasmania. The fast early pace put the leaders well on schedule to eclipse Morning Glory's 1996 race record, but that was before the far tougher conditions forecast for overnight Saturday night. Morning Glory, a German maxi, broke the 21-year-old race record two years ago, arriving in Hobart 2 days, 14 hours, seven minutes and 10 seconds after she left Sydney."}
