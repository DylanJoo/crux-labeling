The yachts were bracing for a tough night with thunderstorms predicted ahead of a west-southwesterly change expected to lash the south coast by Sunday morning. Earlier, a crowd of around 300,000 people on the Sydney headlands and water witnessed the start of the annual blue water classic. Sayonara took the initial honors when she beat Brindabella though Sydney heads, but the 1997 line honors winner drew level when the American maxi's spinnaker blew out and had to be replaced."}
