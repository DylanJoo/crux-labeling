The two dead were found on the 40-foot (12-meter) vessel Business Post Naiad, about 60 miles (100 kilometers) off the New South Wales town of Merimbula, according to the Australian Search and Rescue Coordination Center in Canberra. Seven others on board were taken to a hospital by helicopter, the center said. The center was unable to identify the sailors, say how they died or give details on the injuries sustained by surviving crewmen."}
