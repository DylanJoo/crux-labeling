British sailor Glyn Charles was swept off the Sword of Orion on Sunday night when the boat rolled in wild seas, and at the time of the report, had been missing for about 17 hours. Charles had sailed in four Admiral's Cups and represented Britain in the Star Class at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics. Meanwhile, about 56 sailors had been winched to safety, with many suffering hand, leg, and facial injuries after their yachts were knocked down or rolled over in the severe conditions."}
