The tribunal cleared Delalic of responsibility for war crimes committed against Serb captives at a Bosnian government-run prison camp under his command. However, Prosecutor Grant Niemann announced that he would appeal Delalic's acquittal and requested that judges keep him in custody pending the outcome of the appeal."}
