The victims included a 3-year-old girl, a 12-year-old boy, and two older men, Habib, 51, and Hysen, 53. The bodies of two missing teenage girls, Mehane, 16, and Antigua, 13, were found in the bushes near an abandoned Serbian police compound on October 3. Later in the month, the body of Hajriz was found pushed down a well, close to the ravine. One uncle, Sharif, who was in the ravine, is still missing, presumed dead. The Delijaj massacre is considered the most vicious of a pattern of attacks on civilians by the Serbs in the Kosovo conflict."}
