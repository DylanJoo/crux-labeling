{"id": "duc04-testb-22:7#22", "contents": "Jelisic admitted in interviews with investigators to far more killings than the dozen to which he has pleaded guilty. The trial is expected to last well into 1999, and Jelisic faces a maximum sentence of life imprisonment. A psychological report stated that Jelisic was mentally fit to stand trial but suffered a \"borderline personality disorder.\" During the trial, Jelisic took notes on his laptop computer and appeared impassive, looking around the courtroom. His campaign of murder stands out for its cold-bloodedness, with witnesses testifying that he declined assistance from a guard, noting that he was still in \"good form\" even after killing over 60 people."}
