In entering those guilty pleas, Jelisic told the tribunal he wanted to ``cleanse my soul.'' He will officially be convicted of those charges during the genocide trial. Jelisic's victims were killed in or near the Serb-run Luka prison camp, a former port complex on the banks of the Sava River. Although most victims were men, Jelisic also clubbed one female inmate with a police baton and then fatally shot her. U.N. prosecutors say Jelisic identified himself to prisoners as the ``Serb Adolf,'' a reference to Hitler, and bragged about the number of Muslims he had killed."}
