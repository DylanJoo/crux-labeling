{"id": "duc04-testb-22:9#29", "contents": "The trial, which ended with Monday's verdicts, focused on the brutal mistreatment of the Bosnian Serbs, themselves blamed for the vast majority of the conflict's war crimes. Survivors described the campaign of terror unleashed against Serbs in the area, including inmates at the Celebici prison camp being beaten to death by guards wielding baseball bats, wooden planks, and rifle butts. Others were set on fire, raped, and forced to commit sexual acts with members of their own family. The 49-page indictment detailing atrocities at Celebici asserts that at least 14 prisoners were killed in 1992."}
