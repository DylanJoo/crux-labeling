The leftist Workers Party has criticized the government for building an $800,000 moat around Congress to keep protesters out, while also spending money on running shoes, Persian carpets, and gold cufflinks for visiting dignitaries. Additionally, some state governors are promising pay raises and public works projects that could undermine the austerity plan. Cardoso is reportedly planning to hold local governments to bimonthly limits on spending in an effort to rein in the free-spending habits of provincial politicians."}
