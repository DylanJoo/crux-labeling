{"id": "duc04-testb-23:11#33", "contents": "Brazilian officials concluded a four-day meeting with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on Tuesday without announcing concrete measures to reduce government deficits, despite previous public pledges. Pedro Parente, executive secretary of the Brazilian Finance Ministry, provided details on Brazil's plans to achieve a primary account surplus over the next three years, but did not specify how the government would achieve the necessary savings. With gubernatorial runoffs approaching on Sunday, market analysts did not expect an announcement until after the elections. Instead, the government's strategy seemed to focus on reassuring the markets that work on cutting the deficit was underway, without providing opponents with fodder for the elections."}
