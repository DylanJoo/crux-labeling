Protecting their economies from the spreading economic turmoil, which is affecting more countries than at any time since the early 1980s, is key to maintaining world economic stability. As Latin America's biggest economy and the eighth-largest in the world, Brazil's economic collapse could have far-reaching consequences for the rest of the continent. To mitigate this risk, Cardoso is preparing austerity measures, including spending cuts, tax hikes, and lower interest rates, to help Brazil qualify for an International Monetary Fund rescue package worth an estimated $30 billion."}
