His win has been met with public elation in his homeland, with many seeing it as a long-overdue recognition of Portugal's literary contribution. Saramago expressed his personal delight and shared the honor with his country, hoping that the prize would make Portugal and its language \"more visible and audible.\" The Swedish Academy's decision was also welcomed by Portuguese President Jorge Sampaio and Prime Minister Antonio Guterres, who described the award as a cause for \"great collective satisfaction\" and a \"prize for Portugal and the Portuguese language.\""}
