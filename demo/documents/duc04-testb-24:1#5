He is among the 139 candidates for the prize being announced in Oslo, although early speculation suggests that the award may go to someone involved in the Northern Ireland peace process, Czech President Vaclav Havel, or a human rights activist. In hindsight, some members of the committee have expressed regret over awarding the prize to Begin, who four years later ordered an invasion of southern Lebanon that resulted in the deaths of thousands of civilians. Kare Kristiansen, a former committee member, has stated that if the committee had waited, Begin probably would not have won the prize."}
