Sinai Hospital in Manhattan, said that ``the discovery of nitric oxide and its function is one of the most important in the history of cardiovascular medicine.'' Doctors have learned from the prize-winning research that in heart disease, the endothelium, or inner lining of arteries, makes less nitric oxide. Drugs like nitroglycerine, however, can help replenish stores of nitric oxide. Now, drug companies are trying to develop more powerful heart drugs based on newer knowledge of nitric oxide's role as a signal molecule. Researchers have also learned that nitric oxide produced in the endothelium rapidly spreads through cell membranes to the underlying muscle cells in arteries. Then it can shut off muscle contractions in the arteries, thus widening them and reducing blood pressure."}
