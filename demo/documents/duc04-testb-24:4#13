Louis Ignarro was cited for his conclusion in 1986 that EDRF was identical to nitric oxide, which was based on a series of analyses conducted independently of Furchgott. Murad's work, conducted over several years and at various institutions, showed that a gas could regulate important cellular functions and studied how nitroglycerin and related heart drugs led to the release of nitric oxide. The announcement of these findings was made by Furchgott and Ignarro at a symposium in 1986, but the papers were not published until 1998."}
