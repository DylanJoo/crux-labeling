Kabila has transformed Kindu into a launching pad for a counteroffensive against rebel positions in eastern Congo. The conflict has drawn in many of Congo's neighbors, with unconfirmed reports of troops from Chad and Sudan involved in defending Kindu. Kabila accuses Rwanda and Uganda of sponsoring the new fighting, while both countries claim to have legitimate security interests in eastern Congo. The rebels now control one-third of Kindu and are poised to overrun the rest of the town."}
