However, the commission will also find that the ANC and PAC were \"morally and politically accountable\" for gross human rights violations. The report will criticize the ANC for blurring the line between military and civilian targets, and for the actions of its members, including Winnie Madikizela-Mandela and her Mandela United Football Club, which were accused of killings, torture, and kidnappings."}
