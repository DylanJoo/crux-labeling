During this period, the South African Defense Force (S.A.D.F.) committed gross human rights violations, including deliberate unlawful killings, torture, and forced abductions. The S.A.D.F. also provided covert logistical and financial assistance to organizations opposed to the ideology of the A.N.C. and other liberation movements. Furthermore, the Commission finds that the S.A.D.F. conspired with Inkatha to create a paramilitary unit to be deployed against persons and organizations perceived to be opposed to both the South African Government and Inkatha."}
