The Commission notes that the A.N.C. undertook military operations that sometimes resulted in civilian casualties due to poor intelligence and reconnaissance. Additionally, the Commission finds that the A.N.C. is morally and politically accountable for creating a climate that led to gross human rights violations by civilians who saw themselves as A.N.C. supporters."}
