His lawyer, Jeremy Gauntlett, said that de Klerk is happy to be in court, rather than dealing with the commission, which he believes is trying to \"criminalize\" the liberation struggle. The commission has accused de Klerk of failing to report his knowledge of bombings carried out by former Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok and Police Commissioner Johan van der Merwe, which could open him up to criminal prosecution. De Klerk has not applied for amnesty in this matter or any other related to the commission's report."}
