She speaks fluent English, German, French, and Italian, and met her Canadian husband, Roger Iliffe, 30, while attending the University of Bocconi business school in Milan in 1995. They both speak four languages and have lived and traveled extensively. Mrs. Iliffe works on the Eastern European desk of a British bank, while her husband works for a major international consulting firm. They originally planned to work in Italy, but the prevailing attitude towards working women made it impossible for Mrs. Iliffe to find a suitable job."}
