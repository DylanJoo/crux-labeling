Cook stated that Britain would like to see the two suspects in custody by December 21, the 10th anniversary of the Pan Am bombing. However, he emphasized that Britain will not compromise on the demand that the suspects serve any sentence in a Scottish jail. Libya has proposed that any prison terms be served in the Netherlands or Libya. Annan is attempting to get Libya to agree to a U.S.-British plan to try the two suspects before a panel of Scottish judges in the Netherlands."}
