The trial's primary aim should be to reveal the truth, free from any political or security background. This statement was made during the General People's Congress, Libya's parliament, which has begun debating the fate of the two men wanted in connection with the December 21, 1988, bombing that killed 270 people on board and on the ground in the Scottish town of Lockerbie."}
