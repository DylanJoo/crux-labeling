Secretary-General Kofi Annan met with Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi in a desert tent, where they discussed the possibility of bringing two suspects to trial for the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am airliner. Annan expressed optimism that an arrangement could be reached in the \"not too distant future.\" The meeting was part of Annan's 15-hour diplomatic effort to convince Libya to hand over Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah, who are suspected of the bombing that killed 270 people. Annan is trying to get Libya to agree to a U.S.-British plan to try the two suspects before a panel of Scottish judges in the Netherlands."}
