He emphasized that the country is semi-destroyed and needs the maximum effort and work of every citizen. The death toll from Hurricane Mitch was revised downward to 6,076 people in Honduras, with 4,621 reported missing. The numbers were adjusted due to better access to affected areas and more reliable information. The storm also caused significant damage in Nicaragua, El Salvador, Guatemala, Mexico, and Costa Rica, resulting in thousands of deaths and widespread destruction."}
