He claimed that Atlanta's victory in the 1996 games was not clean, which was disputed by the U.S. Olympic Committee. Hodler also quoted Spyros Metaxa, the head of the Athens bid, as saying that he would do whatever it took to win the games, including spending $100,000, $10 million, or $100 million. Hodler expressed skepticism about the cleanliness of Sydney's election for the 2000 games, stating that he would be surprised if it were different from other bids. The controversy surrounding the Salt Lake City bid committee's scholarship program also continued, with Hodler contesting the claim that the current organizing committee was not directly involved."}
