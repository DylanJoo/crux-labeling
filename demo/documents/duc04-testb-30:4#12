The opposition parties, led by Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy, have requested that King Norodom Sihanouk host a summit meeting after failed post-election negotiations with Hun Sen's party to form a new government. However, Hun Sen has refused, stating that all meetings related to Cambodian affairs must be conducted within the country, as \"internationalizing\" the issue would be detrimental to Cambodia's sovereignty."}
