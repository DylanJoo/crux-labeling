The assurances were particularly directed at Sam Rainsy, the leader of a vocally anti-Hun Sen opposition party, who was forced to take refuge in the U.N. offices in September to avoid arrest after Hun Sen accused him of being behind a plot against his life. Sam Rainsy and the 14 members of parliament from his party have been overseas for two months. However, a deal reached between Hun Sen and his chief rival, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, on forming a new government last week has opened the door for their return."}
