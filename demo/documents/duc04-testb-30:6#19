After a three-month impasse, they agreed last week to a coalition deal that will make Hun Sen sole prime minister and Ranariddh president of the National Assembly. The parties are to form working groups this week to divide remaining government posts and draft a constitutional amendment to form a new Senate. Hun Sen and Ranariddh are scheduled to meet Nov. 23 to review the results of the working groups and give their final approval."}
