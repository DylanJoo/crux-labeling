The opposition leaders, currently out of the country, have accused the ruling party of widespread intimidation and fraud during the July elections. As a result, they claim the government has not secured the required two-thirds majority in parliament to form the next government. In a letter to ADB President Mitsuo Sato, Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy urged the bank to stop lending to the current regime, describing it as a \"caretaker government\" that lacks parliamentary approval."}
