The royalist party believes that no party with seats at the National Assembly should be left out if transparency and a check and balance system is to be used in government. Additionally, FUNCINPEC is seeking the chairmanship of one of the national assembly's nine commissions for the Sam Rainsy Party. The party is adamant that it is now its turn to take the presidency, having allowed the CPP to hold the post despite its win in the 1993 general elections."}
