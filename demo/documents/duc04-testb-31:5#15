Ecevit, of the Democratic Left Party, spent three weeks attempting to form a government that could command a majority of votes in Parliament, but ultimately gave up. Mesut Yilmaz, the former Premier, stated that \"no party leader can form a government that can win a vote of confidence,\" after talks with Demirel."}
