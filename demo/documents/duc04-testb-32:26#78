For example, bundling tires with an automobile or buttons with shirts can make the product easier to use or enable the company to recover development costs. However, tying can also be detrimental if it leads to monopoly power. The courts have not provided clear guidance on distinguishing between good and bad tying, which is at the heart of the legal dispute between Microsoft and the Justice Department."}
