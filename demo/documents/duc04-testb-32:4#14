The he-said, she-said round of e-mail messages being dragged out in court cases is viewed by some as little different from the exaggerated trash talking that goes on in professional sports. Indeed, there is evidence that the darker view of Gates and his company has so far taken root only in the District of Columbia and in Silicon Valley, where the computer industry has long felt the impact of Gates' tactics, and where bitterness and distrust of Microsoft are deep. In the rest of the country, Gates continues to enjoy great popularity."}
