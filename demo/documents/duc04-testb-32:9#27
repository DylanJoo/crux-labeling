A key question in the case is whether Microsoft executives intended to persuade or influence Netscape not to compete in the browser market. Microsoft's Rob Jones, who participated in the meeting, acknowledged that there was a desire to persuade Netscape, but he characterized it as an attempt to establish a mutually beneficial business relationship."}
