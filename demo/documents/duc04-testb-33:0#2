{"id": "duc04-testb-33:0#2", "contents": "The peace talks between Syria and Israel have been stalled for over two years, with the two sides unable to come to an agreement. The previous Israeli government had reached an informal agreement with Syria on a full withdrawal from the Golan Heights, which Israel captured from Syria in 1967. However, Netanyahu's government rejected this agreement, and with Sharon's appointment, it seems unlikely that the peace process will move forward. As Tishrin put it, Netanyahu has sent a ``clear message'' to those who believe Israel will change its stance, telling them to ``give up their illusions.''"}
