Tishrin, a newspaper that often speaks for the government, stated that Netanyahu has sent \"a clear message to all those who are deluding themselves\" about Israel's willingness to make peace. The paper also referenced the informal agreement on a full withdrawal from the Golan Heights that was reached between Syria and the previous Israeli government, but was rejected by Netanyahu's government.
