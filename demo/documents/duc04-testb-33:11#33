{"id": "duc04-testb-33:11#33", "contents": "Ariel Sharon's appointment as the Israeli foreign minister has been met with skepticism and criticism from Arab nations. In Syria, the official newspaper Tishrin described the appointment as \"the bullet of mercy\" for the Middle East peace process, implying that it will bring a swift end to the already stalled negotiations. Many Arabs are familiar with Sharon's role in Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon and his indirect responsibility for the massacre of hundreds of Palestinian refugees. The appointment has been seen as a clear message from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that Israel will not change its anti-peace stance."}
