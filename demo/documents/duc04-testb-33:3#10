He later served as defense minister in Begin's government from 1981. However, his tenure as defense minister was marked by controversy, particularly with regards to the 1982 invasion of Lebanon. Sharon was held indirectly responsible for the massacre of hundreds of Palestinian civilians in the Sabra and Shatilla refugee camps, which led to his resignation as defense minister. As a result, he was relegated to second-rank posts for the next 15 years."}
