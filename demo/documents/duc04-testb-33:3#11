Two years later, in October 1998, Netanyahu appointed him foreign minister, placing him in charge of negotiations with the Palestinians. This marked Sharon's return to the center of Israeli politics and the world political arena. Prior to this appointment, Sharon had served as trade minister in the national unity government from 1984-90 and as housing minister from 1990-92, presiding over a settlement drive in the West Bank and Gaza Strip."}
