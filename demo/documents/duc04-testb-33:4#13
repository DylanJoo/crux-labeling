Levy, a moderate, opposed Netanyahu's hardline negotiating strategy with the Palestinians. Sharon's potential appointment would signal a toughening of Israel's stance, which could further strain relations with Arab neighbors. Sharon's past actions, including leading Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon and strengthening Jewish settlement in captured territories, have been marked by a hawkish approach."}
