This development effectively puts Sharon, a hard-liner, in charge of negotiating Israel's final borders with the Palestinians. Many Arabs associate Sharon with Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon, where an Israeli tribunal found him indirectly responsible for the massacre of hundreds of Palestinian refugees by Christian Lebanese militiamen at two Beirut camps."}
