With its proposed purchase of Netscape Communications Corp., AOL hopes to take a significant step towards this goal. The $4 billion deal, if completed, would give AOL a leading Internet brand and a larger audience by absorbing the millions who visit Netscape's NetCenter site. Acquiring Netscape would enhance AOL's role as the premier Internet media company, allowing it to assemble a large audience that would convince people the Internet is becoming a mainstream media."}
