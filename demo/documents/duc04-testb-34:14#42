Industry analysts suggest that the companies may have been emboldened to take stronger anti-Microsoft steps based partly on the perception that the antitrust case would weaken Microsoft. However, executives involved in the talks claim that the timing of the proposed deal was unrelated to the antitrust trial. AOL plans to keep Microsoft's Internet Explorer browser as the default choice on its online service, which could be seen as proof that AOL still regards placement on the Windows desktop as crucial."}
