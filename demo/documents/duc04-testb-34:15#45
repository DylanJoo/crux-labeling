Sun Microsystems, a corporate software company, could be a strong partner for AOL in the market for Internet commerce software. As AOL moves increasingly to Internet technology, Sun's Java programming language is likely to play a key role. The acquisition of Netscape's browser, which no longer generates revenue on its own, is also strategically important for Sun, as it provides a distribution channel for Java technology and counters Microsoft's dominance in the browser market."}
