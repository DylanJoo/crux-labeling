{"id": "duc04-testb-34:3#10", "contents": "During the trial, Microsoft lawyer Michael Lacovara questioned government witness Frederick Warren-Boulton, an economist, about the proposed acquisition. Lacovara suggested that the deal undermines Warren-Boulton's argument that Microsoft is headed towards obtaining a monopoly in Internet browser software. Warren-Boulton responded that AOL's incentive to distribute Microsoft software would not be changed by the proposed merger with Netscape. He also noted that America Online officials had said their need to be among the online services featured in Windows forced them to accept Microsoft terms. Lacovara then asked Warren-Boulton if the combination tells him something about the nature of competition in the software industry. Warren-Boulton replied that the potential merger is unfortunate, as it results in the disappearance of a firm like Netscape."}
