{"id": "duc04-testb-35:2#7", "contents": "Starovoitova's career was built around principles of liberty, tolerance, and the rule of law. She championed democracy and human rights long before they became politically acceptable in Moscow, and courageously stood by Boris Yeltsin and other reformers during Russia's transition from the Soviet Union. An ethnographer by training, Starovoitova proved to be a skilled and effective politician, first gaining national attention a decade ago when she won a seat in the Soviet parliament from Armenia. She later represented St. Petersburg in the Russian legislature, using her irrepressible energy and infectious enthusiasm to combat corruption and ethnic divisions."}
