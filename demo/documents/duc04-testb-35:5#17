The aide, Ruslan Linkov, was seriously wounded but provided some description of the shooting to police. Authorities are acting on the assumption that Starovoitova's death was a contract hit, a common event in post-Soviet Russia. Despite speculation about political motives, police have said they have no idea why someone would have wanted her dead. The case remains under investigation, with officials expressing confidence that it will be solved."}
