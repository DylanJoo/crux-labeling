He was forced to cancel public events and made rambling remarks at a state dinner, expressing satisfaction with local facilities he had not inspected. On Monday, Yeltsin reportedly seemed disoriented, calling aides as if they were late for work at the Kremlin and making incoherent remarks during a news conference. His health has become a subject of concern, with some lawmakers calling for an urgent medical check to determine whether he is fit to remain in office."}
