He joked with Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov during a meeting, saying, \"I can't even sneeze\" without someone making a fuss about it. Yeltsin discussed developments in Kosovo with Primakov, Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov, and Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev, and appeared animated and joking, despite looking wan and tired. The upper house of parliament voted on a motion saying he should resign, but it did not pass, requiring a simple majority of 90 votes. The motion carries no legal weight, but reflects growing anti-Yeltsin sentiment in a chamber that has generally supported him."}
