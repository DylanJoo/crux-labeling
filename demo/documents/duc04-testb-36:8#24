{"id": "duc04-testb-36:8#24", "contents": "Russia's Constitutional Court has begun hearings on whether President Boris Yeltsin can seek a third term, a matter that has been contentious earlier in the year. Yeltsin's aides have maintained that his first term, which began in 1991 and ended in 1996, should not be counted towards the two-term limit stipulated in the Russian Constitution. This argument is based on the fact that Yeltsin's first term started before the Soviet Union's collapse and the current constitution took effect. However, opponents of Yeltsin, including Communists in the State Duma, disagree with this interpretation and have appealed to the Constitutional Court."}
