Yeltsin himself has stated that he will not seek re-election, and his physical and political strength has been waning. The opposition has shifted its focus to demanding Yeltsin's early resignation, capitalizing on widespread discontent with the economic crisis. A nationwide labor action earlier this month, which drew around 1 million participants, also called for Yeltsin's resignation. Yeltsin's health problems, including a recent respiratory infection, further diminish the likelihood of another election campaign."}
