Protesters argue that identifying the Indonesian soldiers trained in Australia would enable closer monitoring of human rights issues. The protesters also drew attention to the historical connection between Australia and East Timor, recalling that 40,000 East Timorese were killed by Japanese soldiers for protecting Australian commandos during World War II. Australia had promised to never forget the people of East Timor, but the protesters claim that the country has failed to uphold this pledge."}
