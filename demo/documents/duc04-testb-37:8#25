The EU has urged Indonesia to bring about a \"real and substantial reduction\" in troop levels and has called for the establishment of a permanent U.N. presence in East Timor. Furthermore, the EU has demanded the release of jailed Timorese rebel leader Xanana Gusmao and all other political prisoners. These demands are part of a broader effort to address the ongoing human rights concerns in East Timor."}
