Defense Minister Ismet Sezgin attempted to downplay the situation, stating that war was the last resort. However, other reports speculated that Turkey could launch pinpoint attacks on Syrian-controlled areas in Lebanon, where Turkey claimed the rebels had bases. The conflict had been ongoing since 1984, with the Kurdish minority seeking autonomy and resulting in the deaths of around 37,000 people.
