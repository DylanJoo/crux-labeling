Black politicians in North Carolina, Maryland, and California reported that their fears of an indifferent black turnout had proved groundless, and that black votes were indispensable to many hard-pressed Democratic candidates. The figures on Hispanic voting showed dramatic differences, with Democratic candidates performing well in California, where the outgoing Republican governor had played the anti-immigration card.
