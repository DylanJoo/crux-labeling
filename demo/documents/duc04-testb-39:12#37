However, Carville remained undeterred, stating that he would not be muzzled and would continue to speak out against the Republicans. He even went so far as to ridicule his own party, saying that if there is a Democratic strategy for the election, no one has shared it with him. Carville's defiance has led some to wonder if he will continue to be a thorn in the side of the Democratic leadership."}
