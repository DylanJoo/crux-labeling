With their numbers reduced, the Republican leadership will need to carry out a tortuous balancing act to unite a hard-core conservative faction that wants a more aggressive social agenda with a bloc of moderates who want their party to return to the center. The Democrats held 206 seats, and one was held by an independent. Any small Republican faction will now have enormous leverage. The new arithmetic of the House may even lead to Democrats' and moderate Republicans' forming ad hoc majorities on issues, taking control away from Republican leaders."}
