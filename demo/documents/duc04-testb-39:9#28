{"id": "duc04-testb-39:9#28", "contents": "Tuesday was a great day for Vice President Al Gore, with at least three reasons contributing to his success. He worked tirelessly to persuade Democratic loyalists to vote, appearing on behalf of 224 candidates in the last ten days before the balloting. Moderates within his party won crucial elections, including the California gubernatorial race, where Lt. Gov. Gray Davis won a smashing victory. The returns also made the impeachment of President Clinton less likely, which could benefit Gore in the presidential nomination process and ultimately, the election."}
