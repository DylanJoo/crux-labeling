{"id": "duc04-testb-39:9#29", "contents": "Tuesday was a bad day for the Republican right, with high-profile right-wingers losing across the country. The losses included Attorney General Dan Lungren in the California governor's race, Sen. Lauch Faircloth in North Carolina, and Rep. Mark Neumann in Wisconsin. Both conservatives and moderates in the party said the Republicans had to get back to basics. Speaker Newt Gingrich conceded that the results \"should sober every Republican\" and called for new strategic thinking. The Republican party's approach to the election, making it a referendum on President Clinton's popularity, was seen as a mistake."}
