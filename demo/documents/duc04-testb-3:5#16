However, Mahathir claimed that Anwar was fired due to moral unfitness. Anwar has since been charged with corruption and illegal homosexual acts, and is set to go on trial on November 2. He has pleaded innocent to all charges, which he claims were fabricated by his political enemies. Anwar's lawyers argue that his detention is illegal and plan to prove it in court."}
