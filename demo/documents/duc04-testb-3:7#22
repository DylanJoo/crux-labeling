The two had differed over economic policy, with Anwar saying Mahathir feared him as an alternative leader. Anwar subsequently mounted a nationwide campaign against the prime minister before being detained as a national security risk and charged with illegal homosexual acts and corruption. He appeared in court earlier this week with visible injuries, claiming to have been beaten by police on the night of his arrest."}
