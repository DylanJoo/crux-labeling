However, the talks are expected to be tense, with North Korea demanding $300 million from the US in exchange for the right to inspect the site, while Washington insists on unconditional inspections. The situation has escalated concerns about North Korea's development of long-range missiles, which was highlighted by the test of the Taepo Dong missile on August 31."}
