The US Bureau of the Census has published estimates indicating that North Korea's population has declined by 320,000 over the past three years, a period when the population would have been expected to grow by about 925,000 people. The situation is further complicated by strains in US-North Korea relations over a secret underground complex that some experts worry may be part of a new nuclear weapons program. The US has warned that the \"agreed framework\" that is the basis for its relations with North Korea will be in jeopardy unless the North allows American experts to visit the complex and resolve their doubts."}
