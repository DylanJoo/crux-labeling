{"id": "duc04-testb-40:4#14", "contents": "The Yongbyon complex, which houses a 500-megawatt laboratory nuclear reactor, has been frozen under the 1994 accord. However, Kim estimates that one new facility is already operational, and the other is under construction and will be operational in four to six years. He predicts that the reactor will go online in 2002 or 2003, enabling the production of enough plutonium to build one nuclear weapon within six to 12 months. North Korea would then be able to produce sufficient plutonium to make eight to 10 nuclear weapons every year after that. North Korea has maintained that the underground construction is for civilian use and has offered to open the facility to US inspectors, but only if Washington agrees to pay compensation if the facility is proven to be for civilian use."}
