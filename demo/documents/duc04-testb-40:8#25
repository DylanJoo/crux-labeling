Aides to Clinton denied that his comments represented any softening towards Iraq, explaining that the situation was still developing and the president was preparing for meetings with Kim. National Security Adviser Sandy Berger stated that the administration was consulting with other members of the U.N. Security Council about the matter and that they were prepared to act if Iraq failed to meet its obligations under U.N. resolutions. Clinton had previously called off a strike against Iraq and delayed his departure for Asia to monitor the crisis, emphasizing that U.S. forces remained poised to strike if Iraq reneged on its agreement to let U.N. weapons inspectors do their work."}
