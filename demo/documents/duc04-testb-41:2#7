{"id": "duc04-testb-41:2#7", "contents": "Prodi, an economist, is admired by Western allies for his efforts to tame Italy's bloated economy and reduce government borrowing. He has successfully raised taxes, lowered interest rates, and reduced the deficit, allowing Italy to meet the requirements for euro membership. However, his fiscal discipline has not been followed by reform of Italy's fragile political system, which is characterized by over 40 parties. Prodi's government was formed by a patchwork quilt of center-left factions, including Catholic moderates and leftists, and relied on a fringe Marxist group for a majority in the lower house. The alliance with the Communist Refounding Party finally frayed to the breaking point, leading to Prodi's downfall."}
