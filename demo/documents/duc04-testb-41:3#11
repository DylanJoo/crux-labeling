{"id": "duc04-testb-41:3#11", "contents": "If Prodi loses the confidence vote, he will offer his resignation, leaving it up to President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro to decide the next course of action. Scalfaro could ask Prodi or someone else to form a new government, or he could call elections 2 1/2 years early, although this is considered unlikely by most analysts. Prodi's government has held together thus far due to the shared desire to see Italy qualify for the European common currency, but with this goal now achieved, the disparate allies are no longer united by a clear objective. Prodi's government has been marked by difficulties with the Communist Refoundation Party, which has broken with him on several occasions, including over NATO expansion and sending troops into Albania."}
