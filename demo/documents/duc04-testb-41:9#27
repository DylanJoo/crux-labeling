The vote was extremely close, with 313 deputies opposing the confidence motion and 312 in favor. This outcome led to Prodi's resignation, which he submitted to President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro at the presidential palace. Prodi expressed no bitterness over the defeat, instead choosing to accept the outcome with dignity."}
