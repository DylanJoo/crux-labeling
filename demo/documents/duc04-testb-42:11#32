{"id": "duc04-testb-42:11#32", "contents": "The oil industry is facing significant challenges, with low petroleum prices and high exploration costs squeezing companies of all sizes. Despite this, it seems unlikely that exploration costs will decrease, given the remote locations of many promising untapped fields. Meanwhile, oil prices remain low, with West Texas crude trading at around $12 a barrel. This has led to speculation about potential mergers, with Exxon and Mobil reportedly considering a deal. However, Philip Verleger Jr., publisher of Petroleum Economics Monthly, is skeptical about the prospect, citing concerns about the fit between the two companies and the potential role of Mobil's CEO, Lucio Noto."}
