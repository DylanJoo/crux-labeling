{"id": "duc04-testb-42:11#33", "contents": "According to Verleger, Mobil's efforts to expand through mergers and acquisitions are driven by the need to stay competitive in a capital-intensive industry. The company's exploration and production expenditures have been more sensitive to oil price fluctuations than Exxon's, making it harder for Mobil to weather the downturn. Verleger believes that only companies with the deepest pockets will be able to take advantage of the biggest exploration opportunities in the next century, including Royal Dutch, Exxon, and BP Amoco. This suggests that Mobil may be a marginal player in the industry, despite being the country's second-largest oil company."}
