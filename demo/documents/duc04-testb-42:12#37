{"id": "duc04-testb-42:12#37", "contents": "The merger discussions come against a backdrop of severe pressure on Lucio Noto, the chairman, president, and chief executive of Mobil, to find new reserves of oil and natural gas and to keep big projects profitable at a time of a deep decline in crude oil prices. Noto has been working to cut costs and explore new areas, such as Kazakhstan, where Mobil is a partner in a joint venture to develop the huge Tengiz oil field. However, the payoff from such ventures is many years away. Other companies face similar strains, and Noto has not been shy about exploring potential combinations with other companies, including British Petroleum and Amoco. Meanwhile, Exxon chairman Lee Raymond heads a stronger and bigger company, but has also faced challenges in the global petroleum business, including the risks of Exxon's extensive exploration venture in Russia."}
