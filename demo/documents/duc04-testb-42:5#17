As a result, chief executives of oil companies have been forced to consider mergers and acquisitions. The recent agreement between British Petroleum and Amoco Corp. has shown that megamergers are feasible, prompting analysts to predict further consolidation. However, a potential merger between Exxon and Mobil would be challenging due to their different corporate cultures and personalities. The companies have vast networks of refineries and gas stations that overlap in the United States and Europe, making integration a complex task."}
