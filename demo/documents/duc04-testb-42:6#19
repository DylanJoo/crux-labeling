{"id": "duc04-testb-42:6#19", "contents": "The oil market has been under pressure for over a year, with prices falling more than 40% from their peak of $20 a barrel. This decline is largely due to growing inventories of petroleum and decreasing demand in Asia, which has been affected by the economic crisis. On Wednesday, crude oil prices fell to $11.86 a barrel, close to the 12-year low of $11.42 reached in June. In an effort to stabilize prices, members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and other oil-producing nations have pledged to reduce production. However, these pledges have not always been honored, and any rallies in the oil market have been short-lived."}
