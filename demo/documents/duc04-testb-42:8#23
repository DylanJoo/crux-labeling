If the companies were to merge, it would create the largest U.S. company in terms of revenue. A possible merger was reported separately by The Financial Times of London and Bloomberg News. The talks come as oil prices have sunk to their lowest in almost 12 years. A combined company would be bigger than Royal Dutch/Shell Group, the world's largest oil company by revenue."}
