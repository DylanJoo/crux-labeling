However, these efforts have been met with limited success, and rallies in the oil market have been short-lived. OPEC members are currently discussing extending their production cutbacks, and an agreement is expected soon. In the spring, OPEC agreed to reduce production by 2.6 million barrels a day, which appears to have prevented oil prices from falling below $10 a barrel."}
