{"id": "duc04-testb-43:5#15", "contents": "Administration officials have acknowledged that one of the objectives of the August raid on Afghanistan was to kill Osama bin Laden and his lieutenants. A secret review conducted by White House lawyers in the months prior to the attack concluded that such operations are legal under U.S. and international law. The raid was timed to coincide with a meeting between bin Laden and his chief operatives, with over 70 cruise missiles striking the camps. A 1976 executive order prohibits U.S. government employees from plotting or carrying out assassinations, but the White House legal opinion asserts that the president has authority to target the \"infrastructure\" of terrorist groups attacking Americans."}
