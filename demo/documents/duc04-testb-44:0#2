{"id": "duc04-testb-44:0#2", "contents": "Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar has promised to rubber stamp the extradition process if it reaches his desk, but appears to be hoping that it will not come to that. Public prosecutors from Spain's National Court have appealed the judicial investigations into human rights abuses in Chile and Argentina that underpin Garzon's arrest warrant. Aznar has suggested that if the appeals are successful, the extradition request may never reach the government, thereby avoiding a decision. A ruling on the appeals is expected next week, and a decision in their favor would nullify Garzon's extradition attempt."}
