His family and aides have been shielding him from the details, fearing that he would become enraged and suffer a fatal attack. Pinochet was detained in a London clinic while recovering from back surgery. El Mundo's reporter accompanied Chilean politicians seeking his release during a visit to the clinic, where he spoke briefly with Pinochet's wife, Lucia Hiriart, and daughter Veronica. Hiriart expressed concern that if Pinochet knew the truth, he would have an attack of rage and die, given his existing health issues, including a urinary infection, heart problems, and diabetes."}
