The deadline for presenting the request in Britain is November 25th, coincidentally Pinochet's 83rd birthday. The head prosecutor from the National Court has set in motion appeals against several rulings made by Judge Garzon related to Pinochet's detention. The court's plenary is expected to meet next week to decide on an earlier challenge to the Spanish judicial investigations into human rights abuses in Chile and Argentina. The outcome of this decision will likely depend on the interpretation of genocide and terrorism under Spanish law, which could make any extradition request difficult to pursue."}
