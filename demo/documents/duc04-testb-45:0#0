According to Saqib, this excuse is none other than Osama bin Laden, whom Washington holds responsible for the August 7 bombings of U.S. embassies in East Africa. The U.S. had retaliated on August 20 by firing Tomahawk missiles at suspected terrorist camps in eastern Afghanistan, resulting in the deaths of 26 people. Saqib believes that the U.S. is looking for a reason to justify further attacks on Afghanistan, and bin Laden is the perfect pretext."}
