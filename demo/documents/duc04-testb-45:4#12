Wearing gloves and masks, detectives from the Tanzanian Criminal Investigation Division were seen searching the yard of the house, which is surrounded by a high fence. Residents, who were questioned Thursday by Tanzanian police and FBI agents, told reporters that there were four regular visitors to the house, all of whom came at night and used a white 1989 Suzuki Samuri, which is currently in police custody."}
