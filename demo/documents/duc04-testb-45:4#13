Police are also looking for two other suspects, Ahmad Khalfan, a Tanzanian of Omani origin, and Fahad, a Kenyan of Yemeni origin. A relative of Hemed told The Associated Press that the house had been rented by Ahmad Khalfan, who was one of the four regular visitors to the house, along with Fahad, Ahmed, and another man named Hussein. Residents were shown photographs by police but were unable to identify the individuals as they always arrived and left in the dark."}
