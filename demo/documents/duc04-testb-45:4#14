There has been speculation that two men in the Suzuki used a remote control device to detonate the bomb. The bombing in Dar es Salaam occurred nearly simultaneously with an attack in neighboring Kenya, which killed 213 people, including 12 Americans, at the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi. U.S. authorities have charged four people in connection with the Nairobi blast, and Mohamed Sadeek Odeh, one of the men in custody, has identified Ahmad Khalfan as a member of the group responsible for the Dar es Salaam bombing."}
