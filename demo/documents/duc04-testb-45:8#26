The investigation of bin Laden is ongoing, with the FBI fanning out around the world to look into the embassy attacks. U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White stated that bin Laden was charged with \"plotting and carrying out the most heinous acts of international terrorism and murder.\" The government aims to identify, locate, and prosecute all those responsible for the embassy attacks, from those who constructed and delivered the bombs to those who paid for them and ordered it done."}
