{"id": "duc04-testb-46:0#1", "contents": "The word on the sidewalks and in the subways is that the Padres don't measure up against the Yankees. Sure, they have lethal starting pitchers in Kevin Brown and Andy Ashby, and one of the game's best closers in Trevor Hoffman, not to mention prolific hitters like Tony Gwynn and Greg Vaughn, who is hobbling but still dangerous. But how is that a match for the Yankees' World Series starting rotation of David Wells, Orlando Hernandez, David Cone and Andy Pettitte, bullpen flamethrower Mariano Rivera, plus the deepest batting order in baseball? Yet the truth is that Yankees fans are terrified the team will crumple. Baseball fans, even Yankee fans, can spend a lifetime waiting to see a home team of historic caliber, and this Yankee team will not reach that sanctified status unless it ends its record-setting season by winning the World Series."}
