That's not to say the umpires will mess up in the World Series, but they have shown they are eminently capable of interfering with the natural progression of postseason games. All right, so Ted Hendry won't be in the World Series; the umpires' collective bargaining agreement with the leagues does not allow an umpire to work both a league championship series and the World Series. Joe Brinkman won't be here either, even though the agreement does allow for an umpire to work both a division series and the World Series. The three American League umpires who are on the six-man World Series crew did work in the first round of the playoffs. One of them, Richie Garcia, will be the crew chief and behind the plate in Saturday night's opener at Yankee Stadium."}
