{"id": "duc04-testb-46:10#31", "contents": "Martinez's enthusiasm is a welcome sight, given his struggles at the plate in the post-season. He is 5 for 30 with 10 strikeouts, no homers, and only 1 run batted in. His teammates, including Paul O'Neill, are confident that the team can continue to win despite Martinez's struggles. \"We've just gotten through two good series,\" O'Neill said. \"The Yankees won those series. You don't focus on one guy. You focus on winning. The whole team won.\" Martinez's career post-season statistics are also a concern, with a .187 batting average and only one homer and 4 RBI in 29 games."}
