{"id": "duc04-testb-46:12#36", "contents": "Kevin Brown is the best pitcher in this series, capable of winning three games if necessary, should Padres manager Bruce Bochy choose to start him in Games 1, 4 and 7. But at some point, San Diego will need a big outing from either Andy Ashby or Sterling Hitchcock. When Ashby's right, he's hitting the corners with his sinking fastball and his slider, and when his command is suspect, he gets pounded. Hitchcock used his split-fingered fastball to great effectiveness against right-handed batters in the first two rounds of the playoffs, but the Yankees' left-handed hitters may cause him some concern. San Diego's middle relief is the weakest aspect of the team, with Randy Myers and Mark Langston from the left side (the stuff of each has waned)."}
