Brown was pitching with a three-run lead after the top of the fifth, but the Yankees drove him from the mound in the seventh. Brown will not pitch again until Game 4, at the earliest. After Brown's departure, the reliever Donne Wall came in to face Knoblauch, who had earned notoriety for his gaffe in the American League Championship Series against Cleveland. However, Knoblauch redeemed himself with a game-tying home run, which sent the crowd into a frenzy."}
