{"id": "duc04-testb-46:3#10", "contents": "The Yankees had taken an early lead in the game, scoring two runs in the second inning against San Diego's Kevin Brown. Ledee, the rookie left fielder, hit a sinking fastball down the right field line with two outs, scoring two runs and giving the Yankees a 2-0 lead. The fans were on their feet, waving and cheering as the ball landed on the line and skipped off the wall. The Yankees had jumped on Brown, forcing him to throw 32 pitches in the second inning, and they had their best pitcher on the mound, David Wells."}
