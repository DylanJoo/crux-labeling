Their manager, Bruce Bochy, has said that the team will play to win, unlike in 1984 when they were just happy to be in the World Series. Joe Torre recalls being the underdog in 1996, but his Yankees still felt they could beat the Braves. He believes that the Padres feel the same way this year. Torre also emphasized that getting to the World Series is the toughest part, and now that they're here, the Yankees want to win it all."}
