Tagirov vanished Thursday evening while returning to Chechnya's capital city Grozny from a small village nearby. Officials at the prosecutor's office said unidentified attackers seized Tagirov, and authorities speculated it was the work of an armed band seeking the release of one of its members from prison. The victims, Peter Kennedy, Darren Hickey and Rudolf Petschi of Britain and Stanley Shaw of New Zealand, were abducted Oct. 3 by unidentified gunmen in Grozny. Their severed heads were found Tuesday lined up by a roadside in the breakaway Russian republic."}
