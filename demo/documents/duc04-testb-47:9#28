The severed heads of the four men were found lined up along a highway Tuesday outside Chechnya's capital Grozny, and hundreds of Chechen law enforcement officers were searching for the bodies Wednesday. \"We will take all necessary steps to solve this horrible crime,\" said Maskhadov, who has been unable to restore law and order in Chechnya since being elected last year."}
