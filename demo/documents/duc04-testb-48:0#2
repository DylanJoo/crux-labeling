White House spokesman Joe Lockhart stated that the dissidents' peaceful political activities are fundamental human rights that all governments should protect. However, Zhu criticized the United States for interfering in China's internal affairs, saying that there is \"absolutely no contradiction at all\" between China's support for international human rights treaties and its arrests of the two dissidents. China has signed several key U.N. treaties on civil and political rights, including one in October that guarantees freedom of expression and freedom of association."}
