{"id": "duc04-testb-48:2#6", "contents": "Two prominent democracy advocates, Wang Youcai and Qin Yongmin, went on trial for inciting subversion of the state, with their families protesting their inability to hire defense lawyers. The trial of Wang Youcai, 32, founder of the China Democracy Party, took place in the eastern city of Hangzhou and lasted for just two hours and 10 minutes. The court did not announce a decision or say when it would. Wang's wife, Hu Jiangxia, who attended the trial, expressed little hope for her husband's outcome. Wang was accused of organizing a political party that sought to overthrow Communist Party rule and colluding with foreign enemies of the state, charges that could result in a prison sentence of five years or more."}
