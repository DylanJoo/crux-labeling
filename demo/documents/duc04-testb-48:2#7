Wang argued that his activities were legal under China's constitution and an international covenant on political rights that China has signed. However, the judge stated that Wang was not responding to the specific facts of the case. Meanwhile, in the central city of Wuhan, the trial of Qin Yongmin, 45, a veteran dissident, also began on similar charges. The trial lasted for over two hours and will apparently be continued. Qin's family members also reported that prospective lawyers had been intimidated or detained, and the defendant's father, Qin Qingguo, stayed outside the court building in protest."}
