This occurred as Qin attempted to legally register a human rights monitoring group for the second time in a week. A civil affairs official in the Hubei provincial capital of Wuhan accused Qin of engaging in illegal activities, and the police arrived soon after he returned home. Qin was detained briefly two weeks prior and was questioned for about three hours before being released and threatened with prosecution if he persisted in trying to set up his China Human Rights Observer."}
