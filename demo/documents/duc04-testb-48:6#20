{"id": "duc04-testb-48:6#20", "contents": "The indictment against Wang alleges that he helped draft a party manifesto that called for the establishment of an opposition party to \"be rid of this despotism.\" The prosecutors also charge that Wang colluded with enemies of the state abroad, using email to send party documents overseas, meeting with a member of a subversive foreign organization, and receiving money from foreign sources to buy a computer. These charges are considered serious under Chinese law, and Wang's wife, Hu Jiangxia, was handed the bill of prosecution on Monday, according to the Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in Hong Kong."}
