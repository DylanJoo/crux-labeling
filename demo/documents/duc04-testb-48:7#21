Two Beijing police officers warned Xu's colleague, Zha Jianguo, to stop trying to set up a political opposition party, citing Xu's potential charges for having links to \"reactionary groups.\" Xu was arrested Monday night, along with influential dissident Qin Yongmin, in police raids that delivered a stern blow to the five-month campaign to establish the China Democracy Party. Qin was arrested for plotting to overthrow the government, a crime that could land him in jail for life."}
