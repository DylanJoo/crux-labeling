The Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China has reported that many more are missing and believed to be in custody. Wang's wife has accused authorities of violating her husband's minimal rights under Chinese law and ignoring court orders. The center has also criticized the authorities for not ensuring that Qin and Wang have adequate representation, as required by law. Three dissidents from northeastern China have sent an open letter to China's legislature and the Supreme People's Court appealing for fair trials."}
