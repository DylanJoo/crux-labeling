Last Christmas, as South Korea teetered on the brink of financial collapse, Kim Kihwan, a secret envoy, was dispatched to work out a rescue package. Instead of going to the IMF, Kim contacted Summers' office at the Treasury and flew to Washington to negotiate directly. The Treasury then sent David Lipton to shadow the IMF staff's negotiations with the South Korean government. Fischer expressed displeasure at this development, arguing that clear authority was necessary for effective negotiations."}
