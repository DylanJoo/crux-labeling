{"id": "duc04-testb-49:11#35", "contents": "The pattern was repeated in the Russian bailout, with the U.S. pushing for a $17 billion package despite the IMF staff's initial assessment that Russia needed no money. Camdessus was hesitant to commit IMF resources, but ultimately relented. The first installment of the payment was wasted, propping up the currency long enough for wealthy Russians to withdraw their funds. The agreement ultimately collapsed, and the IMF's aid program was suspended. The failure of the Russian bailout has led to recriminations, with some IMF officials complaining that they allowed Rubin and Summers to dictate the terms of the deal, which fell apart within weeks."}
