The Syrian government has long been a dominant player in Lebanese politics, and its support for Lahoud was seen as a crucial factor in his election. The unanimous vote in parliament reflects the broad support for Lahoud among Lebanese politicians, who see him as a strong leader capable of guiding the country through its current challenges.
