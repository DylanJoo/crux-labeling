Despite being the front-runner to form the next government, Hariri failed to receive the expected speedy appointment from new President Emile Lahoud. According to sources, Hariri was \"outraged\" that only 62 of the 128 members in Parliament declared their support for him during a meeting with Lahoud. The constitution requires the president to appoint the prime minister and a Cabinet through a decree issued after consulting with Parliament members."}
