The country's power is shared equally among a Maronite Christian president, a Sunni Muslim prime minister, and a Shiite Parliament speaker. While President Lahoud may not object to appointing Hariri, the 19 Shiite supporters of Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri may be holding out to emphasize their value. The leading newspapers in Lebanon have reported that the delay could last for days, but ultimately, Hariri's record in office is likely to secure his reappointment."}
