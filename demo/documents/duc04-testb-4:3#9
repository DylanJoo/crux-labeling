{"id": "duc04-testb-4:3#9", "contents": "Walid Jumblatt, the minister for displaced persons and a close Syria ally, has criticized the Syrian-backed choice of General Emile Lahoud as president. He stated that he and his party's three legislators will boycott the vote to elect Lahoud, which is likely to take place before October 23. Although a boycott by Jumblatt's Progressive Socialist Party may not affect Lahoud's chances, it could encourage others to express their discontent with the choice and the election process."}
