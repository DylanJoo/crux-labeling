Agreement among the three officials is essential for the smooth running of the government. With Lahoud having a good relationship with Hariri and Speaker Nabih Berri, little change is expected in government policy. Lahoud's nomination ends weeks of suspense over the identity of the next head of state. He enjoys wide public and political support at home and has good relations with Syria."}
