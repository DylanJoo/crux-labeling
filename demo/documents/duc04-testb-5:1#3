The motive behind the kidnapping was to pressure Italy into extraditing Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan, who is currently being held in Rome. Turkey's most-wanted man, Ocalan, is a key figure in the negotiations between the Turkish authorities and Oz. The situation unfolded at Istanbul's Metris jail, where Calascibetta had been detained since August, awaiting a transfer to Swiss authorities for questioning in connection with a killing."}
