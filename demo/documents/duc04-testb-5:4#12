{"id": "duc04-testb-5:4#12", "contents": "Abdullah Ocalan, the founder and leader of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), a Kurdish rebel group fighting for autonomy in Turkey's southeast, has been detained in Rome, Italy. This development has left the group's future uncertain, with some believing that without Ocalan, the PKK will be left in disarray. Ocalan, who has been absent from the battlefield for at least a month, has ruled the PKK with an iron fist, and his detention has sparked concerns about the group's ability to operate without him. Turkish newspapers have reported power struggles within the PKK, suggesting that Ocalan's grip on the group was beginning to waver."}
