The group has also lost the support of Syria, which has forced Ocalan to leave, and two Iraqi Kurdish groups controlling Turkey's border with Iraq have grown lukewarm in their support. Ocalan's decision to seek refuge in Italy may be a strategic move, as he may be seeking to become a political figure and gain more international support for the Kurdish cause. The detention of Ocalan has sparked concerns about the future of the Kurdish movement, but it may also present an opportunity for the PKK to transform itself and gain more recognition and support from the international community."}
