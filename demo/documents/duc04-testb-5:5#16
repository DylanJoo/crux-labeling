Students cut classes, workers stayed away from their jobs, and 41 Kurds began a hunger strike to show their support for Ocalan. The protesters refused medical assistance from Romanian authorities, instead relying on the services of two Kurdish doctors. The hunger strikers and other protesters are seeking to draw attention to their cause and to put pressure on the Italian authorities to release Ocalan."}
