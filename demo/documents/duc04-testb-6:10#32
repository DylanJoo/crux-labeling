While the country has produced a rice surplus for export in recent years, many farmers are not producing enough to feed their families and are struggling with debt. Poor sanitation, lack of health care, and ignorance of modern child-rearing practices have exacerbated the problem. Davies urged the new government to increase expenditures on health, education, and rural development to address the crisis. He noted that the current budget allocations are insufficient, with defense and security receiving around half of the annual budget, while education, health, and rural development receive only a small percentage."}
