However, public health experts believe that probably more than one million and perhaps as many as three million have died prematurely since the food shortages began. A limited study conducted by the World Food Program found that 10 percent of children had a parent who was dead, while an independent nutritional survey found that 62 percent of children had stunted growth and 16 percent were suffering from acute malnutrition."}
