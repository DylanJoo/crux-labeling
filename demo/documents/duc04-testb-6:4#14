{"id": "duc04-testb-6:4#14", "contents": "The lack of access to proper nutrition has led many North Koreans to rely on \"substitute food,\" made from a mixture of nutritional plants and indigestible filler. This substitute food now constitutes 40% of the average food intake. While it can fill the stomach, it often causes stomachaches and is not a sustainable solution. The Red Cross plans to address some of these issues next year, allocating $3.5 million for food for hospital patients and $1 million for water treatment. However, the long-term effects of malnutrition on the population, particularly the elderly, remain a pressing concern."}
