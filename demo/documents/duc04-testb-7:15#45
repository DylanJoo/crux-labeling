President Clinton has made education a priority, and Republicans do not want to appear unwilling to support it. However, the two sides disagree on how to allocate over $1 billion in education aid. Clinton wants the money to be used to hire 100,000 teachers to reduce class sizes, while Republicans believe local school districts should decide how to use the funds, whether for teachers or technology."}
