Rep. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., is seeking to modify the health plan measure to allow plans to refuse contraceptive coverage on moral grounds, and to eliminate two types of contraception that he believes interfere with fertilization. Democrats, such as Rep. Nita Lowey, D-N.Y., strongly object to Coburn's position, arguing that health plans make decisions based on profits, not morals."}
