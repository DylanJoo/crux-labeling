Mark Souder, R-Ind., expressed his support for the bill, citing the increase in defense spending and aid to farmers. While acknowledging the lack of tax cuts and excessive spending, Souder emphasized the importance of compromise and holding one's nose to vote in favor of the bill. Other conservatives are expected to follow suit, with some citing the need to support the bill despite its flaws. The elections on November 3 may also play a role in the voting decision, as lawmakers weigh the potential consequences of voting against the bill."}
