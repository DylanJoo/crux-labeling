They argued that President Clinton needed to gain favor with Democrats to secure their support in case of impeachment, and that Republican leaders feared a government shutdown if they stood up to Clinton. Rep. David Hobson, R-Ohio, stated that \"Clinton was buying votes\" and \"sucking up to the liberal Democrats\" to gain their support. Similarly, Rep. W.J. (Billy) Tauzin, R-La., believed that the leaders were motivated by a desire to avoid the political damage from previous government shutdowns and the president's need to placate the left by adding costly domestic programs."}
