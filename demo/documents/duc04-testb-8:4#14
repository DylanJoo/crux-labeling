The Palestinians see the visit as a boost to their sovereignty hopes, while Israel is concerned about the implications of Clinton's planned visit to Gaza. The United States has stated that the visit is not intended as an endorsement of Palestinian statehood. The visit has also sparked controversy within Israel, with some ministers questioning the decision to invite Clinton to the Gaza Strip. Arafat adviser Ahmed Tibi stated that the invitation came from Israel and was \"warmly welcomed\" by the Palestinians."}
