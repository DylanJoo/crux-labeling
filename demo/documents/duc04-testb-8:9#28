Israeli hard-liners, including Cabinet ministers, have said Clinton's visit is conferring statehood status on the Palestinian areas. On Thursday, signs reading \"Clinton go home\" were strung along the Tel Aviv-Jerusalem highway and on walls in Jerusalem. The most problematic moment of the Clinton visit will be his address Monday to the Palestine National Council, the Palestinians' parliament-in-exile, and other Palestinian groups, in Gaza City."}
