The Russian-built Zarya control module and the American-made Unity chamber were joined together for the first time, marking a significant milestone in the construction of the space station. The 240-mile-high construction job began with Nancy Currie's capture of Zarya using the shuttle robot arm. Once captured, the two giant cylinders were stacked in the cargo bay, a process that required a computerized vision system and camera views due to their massive size."}
