{"id": "duc04-testb-9:1#4", "contents": "The joining of the two station pieces was a complex and delicate process. Currie positioned the solar-winged Zarya above Unity, and after achieving perfect alignment, commander Robert Cabana fired Endeavour's thrusters to raise the shuttle and Unity enough for the docking mechanisms to snap together. However, the docking ring between the two components did not retract properly, and Mission Control had to intervene to resolve the issue. The problem was traced to the attached robot arm, and releasing its hold on the docked Zarya solved the issue."}
