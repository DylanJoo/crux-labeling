The shuttle and its crew of six snared the Russian-made Zarya control module after chasing it around the Earth in ever-closing orbits throughout the day. Less than an hour after a rendezvous 240 miles above the Earth shortly before 6 p.m., Lt. Col. Nancy Currie of the Army deftly used the 50-foot arm to grab the 40,000-pound cylinder as the craft passed above Russia and to slowly pull it toward the shuttle. Seeing Zarya up close, Col. Robert Cabana of the Marines, the shuttle commander, confirmed that two antennas had failed to deploy from the module following its launch from Kazakhstan on Nov. 20."}
