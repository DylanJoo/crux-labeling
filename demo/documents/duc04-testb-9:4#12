Rain and cloudy skies were once again a threat, but NASA was confident the master alarm in Endeavour's cockpit would behave after a delay on Thursday. The shuttle contains the second station component, and NASA has only five minutes or less each day to launch Endeavour in order to meet up with the first space station part, which was put in orbit two weeks ago by the Russians."}
