After a last-minute alarm on the shuttle forced a postponement early Thursday, the launch went off flawlessly at 3:36 Friday morning, right on schedule. The night sky was clear, and the moon full. With a roar, Endeavour made its fiery ascent and briefly turned the Florida coastline from night to day. More than five minutes and 500 miles later, the spaceship's main engines could still be seen in the distance, twinkling like a new star."}
