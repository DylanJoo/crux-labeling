Moscow's economic and political woes have left Western officials unsure of its ability and willingness to come up with its share of money and technology. The project's total cost is a subject of debate, but the most credible estimates now put the price of assembly and of operation for a decade, the station's estimated lifetime, at $110 billion."}
