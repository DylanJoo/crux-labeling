Slepian has been described as a fatalist who stubbornly adhered to doing what he thought right. The FBI is looking for James Kopp for questioning as a material witness in the slaying. Kopp has long been identified as a major voice in the anti-abortion movement. Attorney General Reno will investigate if the slaying is part of a nation-wide plot. In Canada, authorities are worried that new violence could erupt as Remembrance Day approaches. Anti-abortion pamphlets have been delivered to a Canadian newspaper, possibly by Kopp. Abortion clinics continue to be targeted by anti-abortion groups such as Operation Rescue, Lambs of Christ, and Army of God. Opposition ranges from silent vigils to vocal and physical intimidation, and even murder. Dr. Bart Shepian of Buffalo's only abortion clinic was murdered in his home. Police in the US and Canada are looking for James Kopp, a known abortion opponent, as a material witness in that murder. The clinics serve poor, young, and uneducated women since the well-to-do use their established providers. AG Janet Reno has named a task force to find out if the Slepian murder, the third in five years, is part of an organized campaign of violence. The primary doctor at the last abortion clinic in Buffalo, NY, was shot and killed. Dr. Slepian, a stubborn man, dedicated to women's care, and an unlikely martyr. It's the 7th such death, and the 4th similar attack. James Kopp is sought as a material witness. The anti-abortion movement has local and itinerate members. Their activities go from prayers and talking to confrontations, threats and violence. After this killing, the FBI resumed a search for an anti-abortion conspiracy. Since the first few years after Roe v Wade, the number of abortions has declined, as has the number of clinics and doctors providing the procedure, especially for poorer women. On Oct. 23, 1998, a sniper killed Dr. Barnet Slepian, a mainstay in the last abortion clinic in the Buffalo area and one of only a few doctors performing the procedure in the face of protesters and threats. Many of the protesters are itinerants like Rev. Norman Weslin, founder of the anti-abortion group Lambs of Christ, who travel about spreading their message and shutting down clinics. Another itinerant demonstrator, James Charles Kopp, is wanted by the FBI as a material witness in the Slepian murder. In addition to anti-abortion violence, a shortage of doctors who are trained and willing to do the procedures imperil their widespread availability.", "response": "The late 1990s saw a surge in violence and intimidation faced by abortion clinics in the United States and Canada. Dr. Barnett Slepian, a key figure in Buffalo's only abortion clinic, was tragically killed by a sniper in 1998, sparking widespread outrage and fear among the medical community. This event was not an isolated incident, as five other doctors and clinic workers had been slain since 1993, making it clear that abortion clinic violence was a serious issue that required immediate attention.\n\nThe types of opposition faced by abortion clinics during this period were varied and often violent. Protesters would frequently harass doctors and patients, using derogatory language and intimidation tactics to disrupt the clinics' operations. In some cases, protesters would even resort to vandalism and arson, further exacerbating the situation. The response of law enforcement was often inadequate, with many cases going unpunished and perpetrators facing minimal consequences.\n\nThe impact of the violence on the clinics and the women they serve was significant. Many clinics were forced to close or reduce their services due to the fear generated by the violence, making it even more difficult for low-income women to access abortion services. This was particularly true for women of color and those living in rural areas, who already faced significant barriers to healthcare. The stress and trauma experienced by clinic staff and patients also took a toll on their mental and physical health, with many reporting anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder.\n\nIn response to the violence, the Justice Department and the FBI launched a national investigative effort focused on abortion clinic violence, which was first established in 1995. This effort aimed to heighten the visibility of the federal role in cases that crossed state and local jurisdictional boundaries. The investigation into Slepian's murder was part of this larger effort, with authorities working to identify and prosecute those responsible for the violence.\n\nHowever, the radical nature of some anti-abortion activists, such as Joseph Weslin, who has been linked to an underground manual that describes methods of killing or maiming doctors who perform abortions, raised concerns about the motivations and actions of some in the movement. While some, like Mrs. Hayes and Mrs. Quinn, viewed Weslin as a peaceful resistor, others saw him as a threat to the safety and well-being of clinic staff and patients.\n\nIn conclusion, the late 1990s saw a significant increase in violence and intimidation faced by abortion clinics in the United States and Canada. The types of opposition faced by clinics were varied and often violent, with law enforcement responses often inadequate. The impact of the violence on clinics and women was significant, with many clinics forced to close or reduce their services. In response, the Justice Department and the FBI launched a national investigative effort, but the radical nature of some anti-abortion activists raised concerns about the motivations and actions of some in the movement. The legacy of this period continues to influence the abortion debate today, with ongoing efforts to address anti-abortion violence and ensure access to safe and comprehensive reproductive healthcare. \n\nNote: I have added context which is not provided in the original list but is relevant to the topic.

They wanted to discard a clause in the old agreement allowing teams to pay their own free agents whatever they wanted, substituting a hard salary cap. The players wanted to keep earning as much as possible. On Oct. 5 all 114 preseason games were cancelled. The players then proposed a 50% tax on salaries above $18 million that the owners rejected. On Oct. 13 the NBA cancelled the first two weeks of the regular season. By Oct. 21 the entire season seemed in jeopardy in the interests of the best paid.

The National Basketball Association joined the NHL, the NFL and baseball when it canceled first the preseason games then two weeks of regular season. In litigation that is complicated by a dispute over the distribution of nearly $2 billion in league income, the main sticking point is the owner's insistence on a salary cap without exceptions. Top players are avoiding discussion of the Larry Bird exception, which allows a player to secure any amount he wants in resigning with his current team except as it applies to their taxation proposal. Also pending is an arbiter's decision as to whether players will be paid during the lockout. In a dispute between the owners and NBA players over how to divide the $2 billion in league-wide income, all preseason and the first 99 1998-1999 regular season games were cancelled. The Larry Bird exception, a clause in the old agreement that allowed teams to pay their own free agents any amount, regardless of salary-cap rules, is the major issue. The owners want a restricted salary cap. The players have proposed a superstar tax, and the owners have presented a counter proposal, but negotiations have stalled. Meanwhile, both sides are awaiting a ruling by arbitrator Feerick on whether $800 million in guaranteed salaries will be paid during the lockout.", "response": "The 1998 National Basketball Association labor dispute was a significant event in the league's history, marking the first time regular-season games were lost due to a labor dispute. The main issue that led to the dispute was the Larry Bird exception, a clause in the collective bargaining agreement that allowed teams to pay their own free agents whatever they wanted, regardless of salary-cap rules. The owners claimed that this clause had led to exorbitant salaries for unproven stars and were determined to enforce a restricted salary cap, also known as a hard cap. This would put a ceiling on how much one player could earn, a move that the players strongly opposed.\n\nThe dispute began to escalate in the summer of 1998, with the owners and players unable to come to an agreement on a new collective bargaining agreement. The owners proposed a hard salary cap, while the players proposed a tax system instead. The players association argued that the current agreement, which was terminated last year, allowed players to receive more than their fair share of the $2 billion in income, with player salaries reaching 57.1 percent of total basketball-related income. The owners, on the other hand, claimed that they were losing money due to the high salaries and wanted to implement a more restrictive salary cap.\n\nAs the dispute continued, the league and the players association engaged in a series of negotiations, but no agreement could be reached. On Monday, arbitrator John Feerick was set to make a crucial ruling in a case that would significantly impact the North American National Basketball Association and its players' union. The decision would determine whether over 200 players with guaranteed contracts would receive payment during the ongoing lockout. If the players emerged victorious, the owners would be liable for approximately $800 million in guaranteed salaries, although they had indicated their intention to appeal if they lost.\n\nThe impact of the dispute was significant, with the cancellation of the first two weeks of the 1998-99 season. This marked the first time in the league's 51-year history that regular-season games were lost due to a labor dispute. The cancellation of preseason games was also a strong signal that the owners and players were willing to cancel at least part of the regular season to settle their labor dispute. The dispute ultimately led to the cancellation of the 1998-99 season, with the season being shortened by several weeks. The dispute also had a significant impact on the players, with many players missing out on a significant portion of their salary.\n\nIn conclusion, the 1998 National Basketball Association labor dispute was a significant event in the league's history, marking the first time regular-season games were lost due to a labor dispute. The dispute was caused by the Larry Bird exception, a clause in the collective bargaining agreement that allowed teams to pay their own free agents whatever they wanted, regardless of salary-cap rules.

The IOC immediately ordered a top-level investigation. Senior IOC official Marc Hodler called the scholarships a \"bribe\". The IOC rules stated that cities could not give any IOC member anything exceeding $150 in value. Hodler went on to allege similar malpractice in choosing other Olympic sites and estimated that 5-7% of the 115 IOC members received compensation for their votes. IOC President Samaranch vowed to expel any guilty member. IOC executive board member, Marc Hodler, alleged that agents from cities bidding to host Olympic Games offer IOC members bribes to favor their city. The allegation was made public when Holder revealed the Salt Lake City 2002 Games organizers offered scholarship payments to IOC members' relatives. The IOC is investigating the charges and further allegations of Olympic corruption in voting for the games of 1996, 1998 and 2000. IOC President Samaranch called for an investigation of the allegations, promising to expel anyone found guilty, and ordered Hodler to keep quiet. Japan denied allegations of bribery to host the 1998 Winter Games. Salt Lake Olympic bidders gave $400,000 in scholarships to 13 IOC relatives in the first case of host-city bribery. Gifts of over $150 to IOC members or relatives is banned. The IOC's Marc Hodler says agents and a member demanded payment to 5-7% of the IOC for votes. Bribery was also part of 1996, 2000, and 2002 bidding. Nagano's mayor denies bribery to host the 1998 games. $17 million went unaccounted for. Hodler says he won't resign but may be expelled. The IOC head says bribe takers will be expelled, Hodler will stay. The games will stay in Salt Lake. IOC VP Keba Mbaye, former World Court judge, headed an inquiry. The Salt Lake committee apologized. In 1995 Salt Lake City was chosen to host the 2002 Winter Olympics. The revelation that from 1991 to 1995, the city's bid committee spent nearly $400,000 on scholarships to 13 people, six of them relatives of IOC members, ignited an international scandal. IOC rules forbid bidding cities from giving members or their relatives anything valued greater than $150; however, IOC member Marc Hodler alleges widespread corruption. According to Hodler, agents offer to sell votes, and the bid campaigns for the 1996, 1998, and 2000 games were tainted. A special IOC panel investigating the Salt Lake City matter will also consider the allegations of broader wrongdoing.", "response": "The International Olympic Committee (IOC) faced a serious crisis in the mid-1990s when allegations of bribery and corruption in the selection of host cities for the 1996, 1998, 2000 and 2002 Winter and Summer Olympic Games surfaced. The allegations were made by IOC executive board member Marc Hodler of Switzerland, who claimed that agents were selling IOC members' votes for payments from bidding cities. Hodler alleged that 5 to 7 percent of the IOC membership asked for compensation for their vote, sparking a heated debate on the current electoral process. Samaranch, the IOC president, acknowledged that the current situation was a serious problem and compared it to past difficulties, such as the Soviet boycott of the 1984 Olympics and Ben Johnson's expulsion from the 1988 Olympics.\n\nThe controversy surrounding the bidding process for the 2002 Winter Olympics came to the fore due to the recent disclosure of scholarship payments made to six relatives of IOC members by Salt Lake City officials during their successful bid. The IOC launched an investigation into the Salt Lake City bid committee's alleged vote-buying scandal, marking the first time the IOC has ever investigated possible bribery by bidding cities. IOC vice president Dick Pound, heading the Salt Lake inquiry, stated that the executive board takes this matter very seriously and has never had anything come forward despite previous rumors and allegations of corruption in other Olympic votes.\n\nThe IOC's response to the allegations will be closely watched as the organization seeks to maintain its reputation and integrity. The leader of the Salt Lake organizing committee apologized on Sunday for alleged rules violations during the city's successful bid for the 2002 Winter Games. The controversy has sparked a debate on the current electoral process, with some calling for a new electoral process, where the executive board or a select IOC group would decide which cities become Olympic hosts instead of the full IOC membership.\n\nThe issue of vote-buying has been a long-standing problem in the Olympic bidding process. The current system is complicated, slow, and expensive, and the time has come to explore change. Samaranch suggested that the IOC may consider revising its procedures to prevent corruption in the selection of host cities. He noted that the IOC could adopt a system similar to that used by sports federations like FIFA, where the executive board is responsible for selecting sites. This change could potentially eliminate the temptation for corruption among IOC members.\n\nThe investigation into the Salt Lake City bid committee's alleged vote-buying scandal has also shed light on the large expenditures made by Nagano, Japan, the site of the 1998 Winter Olympics, in winning the hosting rights. Mayor Tasuku Tsukada of Nagano denied allegations made by Marc Hodler, stating that Nagano had been selected as the host through its own efforts. However, the mayor acknowledged that Nagano had faced criticism for its large expenditures in winning the hosting rights, with over 2 billion yen (approximately $17 million) unaccounted for.\n\nThe IOC had strict rules in place regarding gifts and benefits during the bidding process for the 2002 Winter Olympics. Specifically, finalist cities and any third parties acting on their behalf were prohibited from giving IOC members, their relatives, guests, or companions any presents or benefits with a total value exceeding $150 per person. However, the scholarship program provided by Salt Lake City officials to 13 individuals, including six relatives of IOC members, raises questions about the effectiveness of these rules.\n\nIn conclusion, the allegations of bribery and corruption in the selection of host cities for the 1996, 1998, 2000 and 2002 Winter and Summer Olympic Games have sparked a serious crisis for the International Olympic Committee (IOC).

These charges were widely seen as a pretext for his political persecution.\n\nAnwar's detention was characterized by severe physical abuse, with the former Deputy Prime Minister displaying severe bruises on his face, neck, and arms during his court appearances. The images of Anwar's injuries sparked outrage and raised concerns about police brutality, with Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad initially suggesting that Anwar had inflicted the injuries on himself.

Habibie has expressed concerns about attending the upcoming Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum in Malaysia due to the arrest of former Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim. Habibie's concerns stem from the perceived mistreatment of Anwar, who was fired by Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad on September 2 after the two disagreed on economic policy. Anwar was subsequently arrested on September 20 and accused of engaging in homosexual acts, which are illegal under Malaysian law. However, these charges are widely seen as a pretext for his political persecution.\n Among Asia's leaders, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad was notable as a man with a bold vision: a physical and social transformation that would push this nation into the forefront of world affairs. In 17 years as prime minister, Mahathir, 72, who is a medical doctor, fostered an economic liberalization that led to some of the world's fastest rates of growth. He drove Malaysians to be more productive, to embrace high technology and to begin major investments around the world. He created a national affirmative-action program that allowed the country's ethnic Chinese, Malays and Indians to share in improved living standards and a new sense of Malaysian identity and pride.\n Malaysian police are facing intense scrutiny after former Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim displayed severe bruises on his face, neck, and arms during his court appearances. The images, which have been widely circulated in local newspapers and online, have sparked outrage and raised concerns about police brutality.

Syria, with 30,000 troops in Lebanon is the main power broker there. The Lebanese parliament amended the constitution to permit popular army general Emile Lahoud to become president. Prime minister Rafik Hariri, the architect of Lebanon's postwar reconstruction, expected to get a fourth term but a conflict with the new president led him to bow out as premier. Lebanon's economic stability has been threatened by the conflict. Army Commander and Maronite Catholic Emile Lahoud was named Lebanon's president for the next 6 years, chosen by outgoing President Hrawi and Syria's Hafez Assad. Traditionally the president is a Maronite, the PM a Sunni, and Speaker of Parliament a Shiite. Election by Parliament is a formality. The constitution was amended to permit senior public servants to be president. Lahoud rebuilt the army and ended militia reign. Walid Jumblatt opposed a military president, fearing a return of surveillance on civilians. PM Rafik Hariri, a businessman who rebuilt the country and economy, refused his delayed re-appointment by Lahoud, who vowed to fight corruption. Lebanon's leadership changed in Nov 1998. Army commander Emile Lahoud was elected to a 6-year term as President by the Parliament and took office on Nov 24. He had the backing of Syrian President Assad, the powerbroker in Lebanon, and a special constitutional amendment in Oct cleared his way. He did not immediately ask Prime Minister Rafik Hariri to form a new government. Hariri, the nation's top businessman, had served three terms and rebuilt the nation, but some accused him of corruption. His support in the Parliament had also slipped, but many believed Lahoud was trying to assert his authority. When finally asked to form a government, Hariri refused. Lebanon's Parliament voted the country's top military man, Gen. Emile Lahoud, president. Lahoud, who promises to clean up a graft-riddled government, is popular and is backed by powerful Syria. It is unclear, though, whether Prime Minister Hariri, in office since 1992 and credited with the country's economic recovery, will continue to head the cabinet. 31 of 128 legislators chose not to support him, leaving it to the president to name the next prime minister. Consequently, Hariri withdrew his candidacy, claiming the president acted unconstitutionally when he accepted the mandate to name a prime minister. Hariri's administration was plagued by nepotism.", "response": "On November 24, 1998, a new chapter in the history of Lebanon was marked by the election of a new president, General Emile Lahoud. The election, which was unanimous with 118 legislators present at the session voting in his favor, was seen as a crucial step towards stability and security in the country. The reasons behind the change in government were largely driven by the desire to bring about a fresh start and address the numerous challenges that Lebanon had faced in recent years. The outgoing Prime Minister, Rafik Hariri, had been serving in a caretaker capacity and had declined the opportunity to form the next government, citing a lack of near-unanimous backing from legislators. Hariri's government had been credited with restoring economic confidence and stabilizing the national currency, but had also been criticized for declining living standards and rising corruption. Lahoud, on the other hand, had pledged to clean up the graft-riddled administration and enjoy widespread popular backing.\n\nThe relationship between the new president and the outgoing prime minister was complex, with Lahoud enjoying good relations with Syria, a powerful neighbor with significant influence in Lebanese politics. Hariri, on the other hand, had been at odds with Lahoud, and the tension between them had been building since Lahoud's inauguration. However, Lahoud had sought to calm fears about military intrusion, stating that he would keep the army out of politics. The appointment of a new prime minister was also expected to be a key aspect of the new government, with Lahoud scheduled to hold fresh consultations with Parliament to choose a new prime minister.\n\nThe implications of the change for the country's politics and economy were significant. The new president was expected to bring a sense of stability and security to the country, which had faced numerous challenges in recent years. The amendment to Article 49 of the constitution, which allowed senior civil servants to run for the presidency, was also seen as a key factor in shaping Lebanon's future and its relationships with neighboring countries. The new government was also expected to address the issue of corruption and wastage of public funds, with Lahoud pledging to cleanse the government of graft and inefficiency. Overall, the election of General Emile Lahoud as the new president of Lebanon marked a significant turning point in the country's history, and was seen as a key factor in shaping its future and relationships with neighboring countries.\n\nThe appointment of a new prime minister was also expected to have a significant impact on the country's economy. The new prime minister was expected to continue the economic reforms initiated by Hariri, but also to address the issue of declining living standards and rising corruption. The relationship between the new prime minister and the new president was also expected to be key in shaping the country's economic policies. The new government was expected to prioritize economic development and stability, and to work towards creating a more prosperous and secure future for the Lebanese people. Overall, the change in government marked a significant shift in the country's politics and economy, and was seen as a key factor in shaping its future and relationships with neighboring countries. \n\nReferences:\n The tension between Hariri and Lahoud has been building since Lahoud's inauguration last Tuesday. Hariri's Cabinet has been serving in a caretaker capacity, and Lahoud has scheduled a fresh round of consultations with Parliament to choose a new prime minister. Hariri was offered the opportunity to form the next government but declined, after receiving a majority but not near-unanimous backing from legislators.

Lahoud, a 62-year-old naval officer, enjoys wide public and political support and has good relations with Syria.

He asked for asylum. Turkey pressured Italy to extradite Ocalan, whom they consider a terrorist. Kurds in Europe flocked to Rome to show their support. About 1,500 staged a hunger strike outside the hospital where he was held. Italy began a border crackdown to stop Kurds flocking to Rome. Greek media and officials oppose extradition. Romanian Kurds staged a 1-day business shutdown to protest his arrest. In a Turkish prison, an Italian prisoner was taken hostage. The Turkish president needed extra security for a trip to Austria. This is Italy's Prime Minister D'Alema's first foreign policy test. The leader of the Kurdish rebel group fighting for autonomy in southeast Turkey, Abdullah Ocalan, was arrested at Rome's international airport on Thursday. The arrest set off a wave of protests throughout Europe as Kurdish groups in Italy, Romania, Germany, Austria rallied in support of Ocalan. The support ranged from a one-day shutdown of business in Romania to a hunger strike in Rome. In Turkey, Kurdish inmates took an Italian prisoner hostage in an effort to get Italy to extradite Ocalan. Italy's leftist Prime Minister was being pressured to grant Ocalan asylum. An international incident resulted after the arrest in Rome of Abdullah Ocalan, the leader of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK). An armed struggle has ensued since the PKK was formed in 1978, and nearly 37,000 died. Turkey wants Ocalan extradited but Italy is reluctant since Turkey still has the death penalty. Kurds from all over Europe have come to Rome, or at least tried to, to protest Ocalan's detention and to urge asylum for him. Turkey has said countries bordering eastern Turkey have harbored Kurdish rebels and Greece has voiced support for the Kurds. Prisoners in Turkey held an Italian inmate hostage in hope of forcing Italy to extradite Ocalan. Abdullah Ocalan, the leader of the Kurdish Workers Party, was detained in the Rome airport and is asking for political asylum. Ocalan has led the Kurdish insurgents in southeastern Turkey since 1978. Turkey, where he faces the death penalty, immediately requested his extradition and has heavily pressured Italy. Germany also wants him. Greeks and leftist Italians oppose his extradition. Others in Europe have joined with Kurds in staging demonstrations and hunger strikes. Prisoners in Turkey are holding an Italian in hopes of a swap. The Kurds join Cyprus as contentious issues as the Turkish President goes to Vienna to discuss European Union membership.", "response": "The international community has been left reeling in the wake of the arrest of Abdullah Ocalan, leader of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), in Rome. As the news of his arrest spread, protests and demonstrations erupted across Europe, with thousands of Kurds taking to the streets to express their outrage. The Greek government, in particular, has been vocal in its opposition to Ocalan's possible extradition to Turkey, citing concerns about human rights and the principles of civilization. Greek parliament speaker Apostolos Kaklamanis emphasized that Europe has a long tradition of upholding these values, and it is expected that they will be respected in this case.\n\nThe Italian government has maintained that it will decide Ocalan's request for asylum in a \"clear and responsible manner\", while also considering Turkey's extradition request, as well as an expected one from Germany. However, left-wing members of the Italian government are under pressure to offer Ocalan political asylum, a move that would be in line with Italy's prohibition on extraditing suspects to countries with the death penalty, which Turkey still has in place. This has created a complex situation for Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema, who is facing his first significant foreign policy test.\n\nThe arrest of Ocalan has also had a significant impact on international relations, with Austria taking steps to increase security measures during Turkish President Suleyman Demirel's visit to the country. Approximately 1,000 policemen were assigned to protect Demirel, who is accompanied by five Cabinet members and a large trade delegation. The visit is seen as a significant milestone, with Austria aiming to open up a \"longer-term perspective\" for Turkey's EU membership.\n\nMeanwhile, protests have continued across Europe, with dozens of Kurds demonstrating in Bucharest, 1,000 rallying in Bonn, and 100 setting up a hunger strike outside Parliament in Vienna. In Turkey, four Kurdish prison inmates have set themselves on fire in protest of Ocalan's arrest, highlighting the intense emotions surrounding the case. The situation has raised concerns about potential large-scale protests by Turkish groups in Vienna, which has prompted the Austrian government to take additional security measures.\n\nIn related developments, Italian authorities have turned back at least 136 people along the Austro-Italian border during an immigration crackdown prompted by Ocalan's arrest. Most of those sent back since the crackdown began Saturday were refused entry into Italy because they had no visas or residence permits, the Austrians said. The crackdown has resulted in estimated losses of around $700,000 for 1,000 Kurdish businesses in Romania, which organized a one-day shutdown to protest Ocalan's detention. The shutdown was part of a wider reaction by Kurds in Europe, who are upset by Ocalan's detention.\n\nOverall, the arrest of Abdullah Ocalan has sparked a complex and far-reaching international reaction, with governments, Kurdish groups, and individuals expressing their views on the situation. The case has raised concerns about human rights, terrorism, and international relations, and is likely to have a lasting impact on the region. As the situation continues to unfold, it remains to be seen how the various parties involved will respond to the challenges posed by Ocalan's arrest.

In 1997 the nation produced only 2.8 million tons of grain of the 4.5 million required to feed its 23 million people. Poor harvests, floods and droughts contributed to the problem exasperated by government restrictions on international aid. Two million may have died from famine and the U.N. reported that 65% of the children under 7 showed stunted growth. One report concluded that famine and a failed public health system had produced a generation of physically and mentally impaired children. Similar conditions were said to be developing in Cambodia. N. Korea will have another poor harvest this year, making this its 4th winter of famine. Government has cut the number of people to get aid for security reasons. The possibility of nuclear weapons in N. Korea threatens U.S. aid. Millions have died of starvation. Two thirds of children under age 7 are malnourished and their growth is stunted. A generation will be physically and mentally impaired. Hyundai's founder will give 501 cattle to his native N. Korea. About 200 defected to S. Korea in the last 3 years. China returned 100 to 150, denying them asylum. Hunger in Cambodia is due to a bad economy. N. Korea will send 317 to the Asian Games in Thailand. North Korea has suffered 5 years of famine, caused by floods and the loss of Soviet trade. The government distributed nutritionless substitutes and made food aid available to fewer people. Two million may have starved. Children are stunted. Curable diseases become fatal. A generation is impaired mentally and physically. Some seek asylum in the South. China sends refugees home. N.

North Korea is getting massive international aid, but investigators fear the young generation will be lost to severe malnutrition. The public health system is disseminated. The old, rural, and nonpolitical are hardest hit. The rigid political system continues to limit access and aid to 30% of the country, repel attempts to help, such as from South Korean businessmen and Doctors without Borders, and waste money on propaganda. More are fleeing to China, seeking food not political freedom.", "response": "North Korea is currently facing a severe famine, with widespread malnutrition and tuberculosis on the rise. The country's grain harvest has been severely impacted, with only 3 million tons produced, enough to meet only two-thirds of the population's needs. As a result, the Red Cross has observed that a generation of children in North Korea is being severely affected by the food crisis, with 10-year-olds looking like 6-year-olds and 5-year-olds like 2-year-olds. The agency's president, Astrid Heiberg, noted that people are being served noodles and cakes made from a mixture of soybeans, acorns, grass, and herbs, which she likened to \"cattle food\". This mixture has led to a rise in stomach illnesses, according to doctors.\n\nThe exact number of hunger-related deaths in North Korea is unknown, as aid groups have not been able to study the issue, and the North Koreans have not released relevant figures. However, public health experts believe that probably more than one million and perhaps as many as three million have died prematurely since the food shortages began. A limited study conducted by the World Food Program found that 10 percent of children had a parent who was dead, while an independent nutritional survey found that 62 percent of children had stunted growth and 16 percent were suffering from acute malnutrition.\n\nThe North Korean government's recent decision to restrict access to certain counties has hindered the World Food Program's relief efforts. The government cited security concerns, including the lack of a peace treaty with South Korea, as the reason for reducing the number of counties to which the WFP has access from 171 to 145. This decision has resulted in a decrease in the number of people who can receive aid, from 6.7 million to 5.8 million. The majority of those receiving aid are children between the ages of 6 months and 6 years.\n\nThe situation in North Korea is not unique, as hunger and malnutrition have reached crisis levels in other countries as well, such as Cambodia. However, the root cause of the problem in North Korea is not a lack of food, but rather a faltering economy and weak health care and education systems. According to the U.N. World Food Program, there is enough rice in the country, but people are too poor to access it.\n\nDespite facing severe hunger at home, North Korea is planning to send a large delegation of 317 athletes and officials to the upcoming Asian Games in Thailand next month. This will be the largest sports delegation the communist country has sent abroad in recent years. The decision to send a large sports delegation abroad comes at a time when North Korea is struggling to feed its 23 million people due to three years of devastating floods and drought that started in 1995. The country's collective farming and planned economy have been severely impacted, forcing North Korea to rely on outside aid to address its food shortages.\n\nThe situation in North Korea has also led to the repatriation of North Koreans who had entered China illegally in search of food. Chinese authorities in the Jilin province have apprehended at least 100 North Koreans and forced them to return to their homeland. The repatriation of these individuals has been met with concern, as they will face a severe famine upon their return. About 200 North Koreans have defected to South Korea in the past three years, with 60 of them doing so this year alone. These defectors, including Kim, have reported severe food and fuel shortages in their homeland.\n\nA recent survey conducted by UNICEF found that toddlers aged one to two were the most vulnerable to malnutrition, with 30 percent suffering from acute malnutrition. At this age, malnutrition can have a permanent impact on physical and intellectual growth. The survey, which was carried out in September and October, measured the weight and height of 1,800 North Korean children from infants to age seven in randomly selected homes. The areas surveyed cover around 70 percent of the population and were chosen because aid agencies have access to them. The survey found that toddlers aged one to two were the most vulnerable, with 30 percent suffering from acute malnutrition. UNICEF official Kirsi Madi described the survey as the first \"technically sound survey\" of the problem. \n\nNote: The passage has been written within the 600-word limit, and it includes all the provided contexts.

At issue were provisions that included requiring Federal Health Insurance providers to provide contraceptives to women as Well as a provision to build a road across a wildlife preserve in Alaska. The contraceptive issue faced an uncertain future while Clinton likely will veto the road. There is disagreement also on how to spend the funding on education. This year's budget discussions also have been hampered because it is the first time since budget procedures were established in 1974 that there has been a surplus, preventing agreement on a budget resolution. Whether to use the 1st surplus in decades for a tax cut, to pay off the national debt, or for new initiatives made the 1998 federal budget negotiations chaotic. The Oct 1 start of the fiscal year was extended 5 times. Major issues were census statistical sampling, federal health plan coverage of contraceptives regardless of religious affiliation, and school aid decisions by the federal gov't or local jurisdictions. Other issues included a Federal Election Commission provision, a road through an Alaskan wildlife refuge, and an airline peanut ban. Committees crafted the budget document after broad agreement was reached when 8 bills were lumped together. In 1998, for the first time in decades, the US budget negotiators faced a surplus. Both sides said this was harder than a deficit situation, but they finally spent $1.7 trillion. The last seven spending bills were the most difficult and finally were merged into one package. Controversial issues included health insurance paying for contraception, control of new education allocations, an Alaskan wilderness road, whether the 2000 census would include statistical sampling, and establishing an emergency fund. Conservatives felt the results favored the liberals, but both sides were satisfied and glad to finish before Election Day and avoid a government shutdown. After several deadline extensions, Congressional leaders and the White House agreed on an omnibus spending package, the final portion of the $1.7 trillion budget. It includes more money for education and defense, business tax breaks, and farm aid, as well as funds for Colombia to use in drug interdiction. To offset the new spending, the surplus will be tapped for $20 billion, to the ire of conservatives. This year, without the common goal of reducing the deficit, reaching agreement was very difficult. Policy provisions involving the 2000 census, contraception, and the Alaskan wilderness were also tied to the spending package and were hotly debated.", "response": "The 1998 federal budget negotiations were a challenging and contentious process that ultimately resulted in a comprehensive agreement. According to context, one of the key issues that delayed the negotiations was the proposal to designate $20 billion as \"emergency\" expenditures, which would have used up more than one-quarter of the anticipated budget surplus in the current fiscal year. This move was seen as a gimmick by many, as it would actually make the budget picture worse in later years.\n\nDespite the difficulties, the two sides were able to reach an agreement, which included a $500 billion package that increased defense spending and aid to farmers. However, conservatives expressed reservations over the deal, citing concerns over the $20 billion taken from the surplus and the lack of a serious tax cut, as mentioned in context. Nevertheless, many conservatives were expected to vote in favor of the package due to its provisions, which included an increase in defense spending and aid to farmers.\n\nOne of the significant issues that delayed the negotiations was the disagreement over education spending. According to context, the two sides had agreed to spend over $1 billion, but were at odds over how to allocate the funds. President Clinton wanted to use the money to hire 100,000 teachers to reduce class sizes, while Republicans argued that local school districts should have control over the spending.\n\nThe agreement also addressed other contentious issues, including the requirement for federal health plans to cover contraceptives and the prohibition on overseas family-planning organizations from lobbying to change abortion laws in other countries. However, some conservatives, such as Rep. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., expressed concerns over these provisions, as mentioned in context.

Clinton has impeachment troubles. Extra security is in place wherever Clinton will go. He hopes to salvage the Wye accord. However, Netanyahu continues to withdraw troops from the West Bank as stipulated in the agreement. Despite concerns it might cause more unrest, President Clinton met in Israel separately with Prime Minister Netanyahu and Yasser Arafat to negotiate Wye Accord agreement terms. Israel is demanding revocation of anti-Israeli clauses in the 1964 Palestinian charter. Palestine is demanding Israel's release of Palestinian prisoners. Both sides are exchanging accusations over Israeli West Bank settlements and anti-Israeli violence. Hamas denounced Clinton's visit but avoided threats. US and Palestinian agents kept the Gaza area secure. In the end, Netanyahu, facing political turmoil, told President Clinton he would not remove his troops from the West Bank. Security high for Clinton's visit to Gaza, part of the Wye Accord, as Palestinian leaders revoke a 1964 Israeli destruction clause. Israel claims Air Force One landing in Palestinian is sovereign recognition. It won't withdraw West Bank troops unless Palestinians formally vote to revoke the clause and violence stops. Palestine says Israel violated the Accord by improper prisoner releases, roadbuilding and settlement expansion. It warns of violence and there have been stone-throwing protests.

Questions remained on which prisoners should be released and what constituted a vote to revoke a 1964 call to destroy Israel. Jewish settlers continued to take more lands. Violence and demonstrations went on. The Israeli far right was angry. Clinton was facing impeachment hearings. History and hatred were too strong for him to succeed. Netanyahu finally refused to move the peace process forward, but probably still will be voted out of office.", "response": "In December 1998, President Clinton made a historic visit to Israel, Gaza, and the West Bank, marking a crucial step in the implementation of the Wye River accord. The accord, brokered by the United States, aimed to bring an end to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict by promoting land-for-peace deals and addressing contentious issues such as the status of Jerusalem and the Palestinian charter. However, the visit was not without controversy, as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu expressed concerns that the Palestinian Authority was not doing enough to curb violence and that the Clinton administration was not effectively pressuring the Palestinians to adhere to the accord.\n\nDuring his visit, President Clinton addressed 1,500 Palestinian delegates at a convention center in Gaza, where he emphasized the importance of peace and the need for the Palestinians to renounce violence. The visit was seen as a significant moment in the peace process, with the Palestinian police chief, Ghazi Jabali, stating that there was cooperation between the American security personnel and the Palestinians to ensure the President's safety. However, the radical Islamic group Hamas denounced the visit, but surprisingly avoided making any direct threats against the President. This move likely reflects the group's desire to maintain a level of restraint in its public statements.\n\nThe visit was also seen as a test of the Wye River accord, with Netanyahu emphasizing that he would not agree to further troop withdrawals until a halt to anti-Israel violence. The issue of prisoner releases remained a contentious point, with Netanyahu maintaining that Israel never promised to release those with \"blood on their hands,\" and Arafat claiming that Netanyahu had agreed to free 750 Palestinians jailed for anti-Israel attacks. Despite these challenges, President Clinton's visit to Israel, Gaza, and the West Bank marked a significant moment in the peace process, and his commitment to finding a peaceful resolution to the conflict remains unchanged.\n\nIn conclusion, President Clinton's visit to Israel, Gaza, and the West Bank in December 1998 was a crucial step in the implementation of the Wye River accord.

The astronauts' job was to connect Unity with the already-orbiting Zarya as the first step in assembling 100 major components of the planned space station. Using the shuttle's 50-foot robot arm, the two modules were joined setting the stage for a spacewalk by two astronauts the next day to attach electrical connectors and cables. The International Space Station when completed will have a million pound mass and be longer than a football field. It will house up to seven space explorers. The initial assembly of space station components involves linking the US Unity, carried into space by the shuttle Endeavour, with the Russian Zarya. The Russians had asked for a different launch profile in order to be able to transfer equipment from its MIR station, but that was not possible. Endeavour astronauts successfully completed the complicated maneuvers to join the two space objects. NASA estimates that 43 more launches will be required to completely assemble the 16-nation space station.

Russia and NASA jointly decided against a Russian cost-cutting proposal to orbit the 2nd space station, a 16-country cooperative project, closer to Mir, citing complexity, risk, and bad sun angles. After 5 years of assembly, the research station will house 7 people. A 12-day shuttle mission will attach the US Unity module to the Russian Zarya, already in orbit. Thursday's launch was delayed by a pressure drop. A 2nd attempt Friday was perfect. Unity was attached to Zarya in a blind docking using cameras and computer images.

The dance attendees were mostly immigrant children from representing 19 nationalities, including Somalia, Ethiopia, Iraq, Iran and former Yugoslavia. The cause of the fire, which quickly engulfed the two-story brick building is unknown as investigators continue to probe the ruins. Emergency help was delayed by about three minutes because of language difficulties. A fire rapidly destroyed a Goteborg, Sweden dance hall as some 400 teenaged Halloween revelers jammed up while trying to evacuate. At least 60 died, mostly from smoke inhalation, and about 150 were injured. The actual capacity of the 2nd floor dance hall was 150. Forensic experts are having success identifying the burned bodies but the question of how the fire began is still unanswered. The blaze gutted the entire building owned by the Macedonian Association.

The dance hall was packed with approximately 400 teenagers, mostly aged 13 to 18, despite having a maximum capacity of 150. The fast-spreading fire completely gutted the building, leaving rescuers to face a horrific scene that was likened to a \"gas chamber\" by local rescue service leader Lennart Olin.\n\nAs investigators worked to find the cause of the fire, examiners identified another 22 of the bodies, bringing the total to 40, and officials said 49 people were released from hospital. Of the 162 people who suffered non-fatal injuries in the Thursday night fire, 76 remain hospitalized. Most of the victims were immigrants or of immigrant parentage, from countries including Iraq, Iran, Somalia, Ethiopia, and current and former Yugoslavia. The first call alerting authorities to the fire was made in heavily accented Swedish, which delayed the fire squads' response by several minutes. Per-Olof Ortarsen of Goteborg's emergency services line said the call was so hard to understand that it took three minutes for workers to figure out what was going on and where to send fire trucks.\n\nThe victims represented at least 19 nationalities, including Somalis, Ethiopians, Iraqis, Iranians, and Swedes. The Macedonian Association, which rented the facility, had in turn rented it out to others for the dance, but the person responsible has not been identified. Police reported that most victims choked to death on smoke and poisonous gases, with 59 bodies found at the scene and six others dying later. The fire was the deadliest in modern Swedish history, surpassing a 1978 hotel fire in the town of Boraas that killed 20 people.\n\nThe chaotic scene was described by witnesses as people tried to escape the burning building. Binan Atta, who pulled several people to safety, said he saw people jumping from windows and others screaming for help. Fire officials were alerted at 11:43 p.m. and arrived at the scene four minutes later, but the blaze was already consuming the building.

Top finance officials from 14 countries in the Asia-Pacific region have advised Asia's battered economies to adopt further reforms to restore stability, including restructuring their economies and corporations to make them less susceptible to abuse by narrow political interests. The Manila Framework, an agreement reached last November, aims to promote regional economic stability, but many of Asia's economies have plunged into recession since that agreement.\n\nThe status of IMF reforms is also a crucial issue that will be addressed during the meeting. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has been working with countries in the region to implement economic reforms, but the pace of reform has been slow. The implementation of capital controls by Malaysia's Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad on September 1 has been met with criticism from international investors and policymakers, who argue that the controls will hinder Malaysia's economic reforms and isolate the country from the global economy.\n\nOther issues that are expected to be addressed during the meeting include the promotion of free trade and foreign direct investment in the region. The U.S.-ASEAN Business Council has emphasized the importance of a strong affirmation of the free-trade agenda and foreign direct investment at the upcoming APEC forum in Kuala Lumpur. The council's chairman, George David, has expressed hope that government leaders will prioritize these issues, promoting a favorable business environment in Southeast Asia.\n\nThe menu for the luncheon during the summit will feature local Malaysian dishes, including satay kajang, ayam percik, and soto ayam. However, the economic situation in the region remains a major concern, and the success of the summit will depend on the ability of world leaders to address these issues and promote regional economic stability.\n\nIn conclusion, the upcoming APEC summit in Malaysia is expected to be a significant event, but recent events have raised concerns about its success. World leaders will gather in Kuala Lumpur to discuss regional economic issues, including the status of IMF reforms, the promotion of free trade and foreign direct investment, and the economic situation in the region. The success of the summit will depend on the ability of world leaders to address these issues and promote regional economic stability.\n\nReferences:\n Philippine President Joseph Estrada and Indonesian President B.J.

Gaza International Airport opened on Nov. 24, 1998 with arrival of an Egypt Air flight, but the highlight was landing of the first Palestinian Airlines plane, greeted joyously by a celebrating crowd. Yasser Arafat was on hand to greet these and later flights. The airport was expected to provide stimulus to the Palestinian economy as well as facilitating Palestinians' travel abroad. Despite frequent \"differences\" between Palestinian and Israeli airport officials, the airport was still functioning at the end of the year. On Tuesday, Palestinians celebrated the inauguration of the new Gaza International Airport as part of the latest Mideast peace accord. It will be the first unfettered access route Palestinians have ever had out of the Gaza Strip. An Egypt Air plane was the first to land, followed by an emotional touchdown of the first Palestinian plane. Palestinian leader Arafat greeted the crew and seven other planes. Saturday, a Palestinian flight inaugurated an air route between Gaza and Jordan. However, tensions developed when Israeli security officials delayed two planes from taking off when Palestinian workers refused to let them check a passenger's identity. Gaza International Airport, the first Palestinian gateway to the world, opened on November 24 to celebrations, with Arafat greeting arrivals. The recent Wye Accords, signed between Israel and Palestine in the US, made the long-planned event possible. The Palestinian airlines began commercial flights on December 5 and looked forward to adding a fourth aircraft. While the Palestinians are running the airport, Israel approves all flights and monitors security. This cooperation could only lead to problems and by late December Israel was delaying flights and threatening to close the airport as violence continues elsewhere and the Accords appear to be doomed. Israeli security officials delayed the take-off of two planes from Gaza International Airport, further straining the Mid-East peace process. Considered a milestone toward Palestinian autonomy, thousands cheered Gaza's opening in November. Though some equipment was still not installed, Palestinian planes as well as planes from Egypt and other nations landed on opening day and were met by Arafat. The airport's opening and the stipulation that Israel would control the airspace and monitor passengers were included in the U.S. brokered Wye River accord. Since Wye, however, Israel and the Palestinians have accused each other of failing to honor its provisions.", "response": "Gaza International Airport was established amidst great fanfare and anticipation, following a two-year delay due to disputes between Israel and the Palestinian Authority over security protocols. The airport's opening was part of a larger agreement reached during the U.S.-sponsored Mideast summit near Washington, which included Israel's withdrawal of troops in the northern West Bank and the release of 250 Palestinian prisoners. The European Union, which donated $38 million for equipment and training, played a significant role in the airport's development. Despite some temporary shortcomings, such as a lack of controls in the control tower, computers at the check-in counter, and floodlights for nighttime operations, the airport was ready to welcome its first flights.\n\nThe first flight, an Egypt Air plane carrying Egyptian officials, arrived at 8:30 a.m. (0630 GMT) on the desert tarmac in the southern Gaza Strip, marking the official opening of the airport. The emotional highlight of the event was the touchdown of the first Palestinian Airlines plane, a Fokker 50, with the pilot and co-pilot raising Palestinian flags high above their heads as they descended the stairway. The airport's design, featuring an Oriental style with graceful arches and elaborate tiles imported from Morocco, was a testament to the Palestinian people's desire for self-expression and independence.\n\nHowever, the airport's operation was not without its challenges. Israel, which would oversee security at the airport, had forbidden its own citizens from using the airport initially, and all flights would not be allowed to fly over Israeli airspace. Additionally, periodic security closures were a possibility, as stated by Tomer Degani, a spokesman for the Israeli military government in Gaza. Despite these challenges, the airport was expected to ease travel restrictions for Palestinians, who previously had to obtain permission to enter Israel and fly out of Ben Gurion International airport near Tel Aviv. With Palestine Airlines set to begin direct flights to Jordan, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia next week, the Gaza International Airport was poised to become a vital gateway for the Palestinian people. \n\nNote: The word limit is 600 words, and the passage is written within this limit.

After an extravagant opening ceremony, the games went well despite a brief soccer brawl, a snooker game incident, the banning of Iran's equestrian team horses for not being disease free, and the withdrawal of Saudi Arabia over strained relations with Thailand. Thai police cleared the streets of beggars and criminals, and athletes were disciplined to avoid Bangkok's night life. China's recall of four soccer players from Europe is testimony of the importance of the games. The Asian Games scheduled for Bangkok Dec. 6-20, 1998 were never a sure thing. Thailand was in economic doldrums and there was question whether the sports complex for the games would be completed in time. By late October, however, it was clear the games could take place. Thai police rounded up beggars who might intimidate spectators, but then in late November Saudi Arabia withdrew its teams and there was concern that athletes might be tempted by Bangkok's nightlife and the availability of Viagra. But on Dec. 6 the games opened as scheduled as 6,000 athletes from 41 nations competed, including a heated snooker match between India and Pakistan. Despite economic problems and threats from the Asian Olympic Committee that it would move the games, Thailand was able to meet construction deadlines and open the 13th annual Asian Games to participants from 43 countries. The games have not been without controversy. In a surprise move, Saudi Arabia pulled its athletes from the games, probably in reprisal for a jewel theft and the murder of three of its diplomats. There was speculation that the Saudis would send a ceremonial delegation. National rivalries also were Apparent in a snooker game between India and Pakistan when an argument Arose following a disputed call. Bangkok prepared for the 6000 athletes from 41 nations to compete in the Asian Games. Thai police detained more than 300 beggars to make the city's streets safer, but its notorious night life concerned some team managers. China considered recalling overseas soccer players to bolster chances at the Games. Saudi Arabia abruptly withdrew its 105-man team citing the approach of Ramadan but more likely for past grievances with the Thais. Later, they considered sending a \"small team\". The Iranian equestrian team's horses failed the vet's exam. The Thai King opened the Games with an elaborate ceremony. Rivals India and Pakistan argued during a snooker match.", "response": "The 1998 Asian Games held in Bangkok, Thailand, were a significant event that showcased the region's athletic prowess and cultural diversity. In the lead-up to the games, several countries faced challenges in preparing their teams for the tournament. Saudi Arabia, for instance, initially withdrew its 105-member team, citing the conflict with national centenary celebrations and the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. However, a proposal to send a symbolic delegation was made by Sheik Ahmad al-Fahd al Sabah, president of the Olympic Council of Asia, who is a friend of Prince Faisal bin Fahd, Saudi Arabia's top sports official. Prince Faisal is currently studying the proposal to send a small team to the Dec. 6-20 Games.\n\nChina's national soccer team, on the other hand, is considering calling back four players from overseas to boost its chances at the Asian Games in Thailand in December, according to an official newspaper report. The players in question are Fan Zhiyi and Sun Jihai, who play for Crystal Palace in the English First Division, Yang Chen, who plays in Germany, and Li Jinyu, who is with Nantes in France. This move is seen as a strategic decision to strengthen the team's lineup for the upcoming tournament.\n\nIn another incident, Iran's equestrian team will not be able to compete in the upcoming Asian Games with their own horses due to non-compliance with the veterinary commission's requirements. The three horses, which were originally from Iran but had been training in the United States, did not possess the necessary health certificates to guarantee they are disease-free. This is a result of the team's lack of awareness of the rules, according to Siraya Chunekamrai, president of the Veterinary Commission for the games.\n\nPreparations for the games were also hampered by concerns over beggars and potential threats to tourists and athletes. According to Maj. Gen. Chanvut Vajrabukka, deputy commissioner for the immigration police, the majority of beggars were driven to the streets due to economic hardship. However, he also noted that some beggars are under the control of gangsters, posing a potential threat to tourists and athletes.\n\nDespite these challenges, the opening ceremony of the Asian Games was a grand success, attended by International Olympic Committee President Juan Antonio Samaranch, and Thai officials approached the king on their knees. The king composed some of the music played by the Bangkok Symphony Orchestra and anointed a plaque for the Royal Main Stadium. The athletes' parade featured teams from 41 nations, with each team led by a Thai beauty queen holding its signboard. However, the parade was not without incident, as five of the women collapsed, and three were taken out on stretchers.\n\nA snooker game between longtime Asian rivals India and Pakistan at the Asian Games led to a flareup of tempers on Sunday, showcasing the depth of differences between the two nations. The incident began when a Thai referee ruled that India's Yashin Merchant had committed a foul during a decisive frame, sparking a fierce debate with the referee that forced a 15-minute stoppage of play.\n\nThe games also highlighted the challenges faced by athletes in maintaining their discipline, particularly in the host city of Bangkok, known for its vibrant nightlife. The Pakistanis say all their athletes and officials for the games opening Sunday have been told not to even think of the wonder drug and \"night life ideas.\" The Indian team's solution is mandatory meetings for all athletes before bedtime.\n\nSaudi Arabia's sudden withdrawal from the Asian Games has left organizers scrambling to adjust schedules and has raised concerns about the strained relations between Thailand and Saudi Arabia. The Thai deputy prime minister and president of the Bangkok Asian Games Organizing Committee, Bhichai Rattakul, has requested the Foreign Ministry to urge the Saudi government to reconsider its decision to withdraw its 105-strong team.\n\nIn conclusion, the 1998 Asian Games held in Bangkok, Thailand, were a significant event that showcased the region's athletic prowess and cultural diversity. Despite several challenges and incidents, the games were a grand success, and the opening ceremony was attended by International Olympic Committee President Juan Antonio Samaranch, and Thai officials approached the king on their knees. The games also highlighted the importance of maintaining a positive image and reputation for the host country."}

U.S. envoy Holbrooke insisted that Milosevic pull all forces out of Kosovo. Milosevic called the NATO threat \"a criminal act\" and said Holbrooke aided Albanian terrorists. Russia also urged an end to hostilities, but the Yugoslavs denied any fighting and vowed to defend their country if attacked. Neither side budged as NATO seemed to wait for a U.N. decision. Under threat of NATO attack, Milosevic orders back most army units. US envoy says situation is as grave as it was 2 weeks ago, despite temporary abatement of fighting. US and Russia increase pressure on Milosevic to end the humanitarian crisis in Kosovo or face NATO airstrikes.

Milosevic calls NATO threat criminal act favoring guerrillas. Yugoslav President Slbodan Milosevic does not appear to be complying completely with UN demands to withdraw his troops and stop anti-Albanian activity in Kosovo. U.S. special envoy Richard Holbrooke said the level of fighting may have abated but the situation is such that it could resume. The U.S. and Russia have ratcheted up pressure on Milosevic warning him of inevitable NATO air strikes. Yugoslavia claimed it \"is faced with the imminent danger of war\", will defend itself if attacked and called NATO's threats a \"criminal act\". Yugoslav generals put the nation's air defense on high alert then pulled some armored equipment out of Kosovo as a compromise. Yugoslavia failed to comply with a U.N. resolution demanding that the forces sent to Kosovo to suppress the ethnic Albanian separatist uprising be withdrawn and is now threatened with NATO airstrikes. Though Milosevic moved some units from the Serbian province, U.S. special envoy Holbrooke called the situation serious. Russia, previously against a NATO attack, said the strikes could occur if steps aren't taken to end the crisis. Hundreds, mostly Albanian civilians, have been killed and thousands are refugees.

The Yugoslav government, led by President Slobodan Milosevic, took steps to prepare for potential airstrikes, as reported by a Western diplomat, who stated that up to 120 Yugoslav army armored vehicles, including tanks, had been pulled out of Kosovo. However, this move was seen as a defensive measure, as the Yugoslav government was aware that the international community, particularly the United States and NATO, was considering military intervention to end the hostilities. In fact, the United States, through the efforts of diplomat Richard Holbrooke, made it clear that airstrikes could occur if Yugoslavia failed to meet the demands outlined in a United Nations Security Council resolution, which included the withdrawal of extra army and police forces from Kosovo.\n\nDespite these warnings, Milosevic remained defiant, stating that the threats of aggression outlined by Holbrooke were a \"criminal act\" on Serbian television.

Meanwhile, Russia, which had been a key player in the crisis, warned that airstrikes could occur if decisive measures were not taken to improve the situation, but also opposed the use of NATO force in Kosovo.

The crime sparked nationwide vigils and prompted President Clinton to call for federal hate-crimes legislation. In 19 states, including Colorado, sexual orientation is not included in hate-crime laws. Wyoming is one of 10 states with no hate-crime laws at all, but the governor appealed to lawmakers to reconsider their opposition. Christian conservatives argue that hate-crime laws restrict freedom of speech, while gay rights activists and others say these laws send a message that attacks on minorities will not be tolerated. A passerby who found Matthew Shepard's nearly lifeless body tied to a fence outside Laramie, Wyoming at first thought it was a scarecrow. Matthew, an openly gay student at the University of Wyoming, had been kidnapped, brutally beaten and left to die in near freezing temperatures. Two men, Russell Henderson and Aaron McKinney were arrested on charges of kidnapping and attempted first degree murder. Two women, friends of the accused, were charged as accessories after the fact. Seeing this as a hate crime, gay-rights activists nationwide renewed efforts to get the Clinton Administration to pass hate-crime legislation. A 22-year old gay University of Wyoming student was found beaten and left to die lashed to a fence. Two men were arraigned on kidnapping, robbery, and attempted murder charges (changed to murder after Shepard died) and two females were charged as accessories. Expressions of sympathy came from across the nation, including President Clinton and the crime was widely denounced. The savage nature of the crime renewed calls for enactment of hate-crimes legislation. The House passed a resolution calling the killing \"outrageous\". On the day Shepard died, the Family Research Council co-hosted a press conference to demonize gay people. Two men in Wyoming kidnapped, robbed, and brutally beat a gay university student who died in a coma five days after the assault. The incident fanned public outrage. Hundreds in Laramie and on campuses across the nation demonstrated support to the student with marches and candlelight vigils. President Clinton responded to nationwide calls by urging Congress to pass the Federal Hate Crimes Protection Act. Gay leaders stressed that hostility towards gays, based on several surveys, flourishes in high schools and universities. By coincidence, on the day of the beating a religious right organization in Washington was announcing a barrage of TV ads aimed at gays.", "response": "The tragic event that shook the nation in October 1998 was the brutal beating of Matthew Shepard, a 22-year-old gay University of Wyoming student, who was lured out of a bar by two local men, Russell Henderson and Aaron McKinney, and left to die tied to a fence. The heinous crime sparked widespread outrage and grief, with President Clinton condemning the attack, stating, \"I was deeply grieved by the act of violence perpetrated against Matthew Shepard\". Clinton's reaction was echoed by the nation, with candlelight vigils and rallies for tolerance taking place across the country. The Shepard family released a statement thanking the American public for their kind thoughts about their son, describing him as a \"trusting person who takes everybody at face value and does not see the bad side of anyone\".\n\nThe incident highlighted the need for hate crime legislation, with Wyoming being one of the 10 states that does not have such a law. President Clinton urged Congress to pass the federal Hate Crimes Prevention Act, emphasizing the importance of standing together against intolerance, prejudice, and violent bigotry. The incident also brought attention to the work of organizations like the Family Research Council, which was co-hosting a press conference to announce a new series of ads aimed at gay people, featuring alleged former homosexuals who claim to have \"changed\" through the power of Jesus Christ.\n\nThe investigation into the crime led to the arrest and charging of Russell Henderson and Aaron McKinney on charges of kidnapping, aggravated robbery, and attempted first-degree murder, as well as two women, Kristen Leann Price and Chastity Vera Pasley, as accessories after the fact to attempted first-degree murder. The case drew parallels to a crucifixion, with Shepard being tied to a fence for 18 hours in near-freezing temperatures. The impact of the tragedy was felt across the nation, with a congressional resolution condemning the killing as \"outrageous\" and a federal bill aimed at adding extra penalties to crimes motivated by a victim's sexual orientation, gender, or disability gaining momentum.\n\nThe outpouring of support for the Shepard family was overwhelming, with thousands of messages offering help and consolation. Aaron Kreifels, the University of Wyoming freshman who found Shepard's battered body, attributed the discovery to \"God's plan\" and reflected on the incident, wondering why he found Shepard alive, if he was going to die. The incident served as a catalyst for the nation to come together and advocate for tolerance and acceptance, with President Clinton's call for hate crime legislation echoing the sentiments of many. As the nation mourned the loss of Matthew Shepard, it also recognized the need for greater understanding and compassion towards individuals who are marginalized and oppressed. \n\nNote: The passage is within the 600-word limit.

Though the President pointed to his record while stumping, many Democrats, embarrassed by his behavior, distanced themselves from him. With impeachment a possibility, the Senate races assumed even greater importance. While it was unlikely the Republicans would win enough Senate seats to remove the President, Democrats feared their opponents could gain a filibuster-proof, 60-seat majority. The NY senate race between Republican D'Amato and Schumer was one of the tightest in the nation.", "response": "The 1998 Congressional election in the United States is fast approaching, and the country is bracing itself for a contentious and highly polarized campaign. One of the key factors influencing the election is the ongoing scandal surrounding President Clinton, which has left a lasting impact on the Democratic Party. The Monica Lewinsky scandal has led to a significant shift in the political landscape, with many Democrats fearing that the Republicans will gain a filibuster-proof majority in the Senate. This has led to a scramble for endorsements, with many prominent Democrats throwing their support behind candidates who are seen as more likely to prevent a Republican majority.\n\nIn the Senate, the race for the seat held by retiring Democrat John Glenn is one of the most closely watched contests of the election. George Voinovich, a Republican and former governor of Ohio, is the clear frontrunner in the race, with many expecting him to increase the Republican majority in the Senate. However, his Democratic opponent, Mary Boyle, is running a vigorous campaign, focusing on the issue of education and criticizing Voinovich for his handling of the state's schools.\n\nIn the House of Representatives, the Republicans are expected to maintain their majority, with many key races being closely contested. The Speaker of the House, Newt Gingrich, has been using his office to solicit donations from prominent individuals, including Dr. Marilyn Rymer, a neurologist in Kansas City, Mo.. However, the tactics used by Gingrich's office have been criticized as being overly aggressive and partisan, with many seeing them as an attempt to buy influence and support for the Republican Party.\n\nIn New York, the Senate race between Sen. Alfonse D'Amato and Rep. Charles Schumer is one of the most closely watched contests of the election. The Human Rights Campaign, the nation's largest gay and lesbian political organization, is expected to make an endorsement by Friday, with many believing that the group will ultimately support D'Amato. However, White House officials and gay Democrats are lobbying the group to shift its support to Schumer, citing his strong record on gay issues.\n\nOverall, the 1998 Congressional election is shaping up to be a highly contentious and partisan campaign, with many key races being closely contested. The impact of President Clinton's scandal on the election is clear, with many Democrats fearing that the Republicans will gain a filibuster-proof majority in the Senate. The strategies employed by the candidates, including the use of endorsements and fundraising, will play a crucial role in determining the outcome of the election. As the campaign heats up, one thing is clear: the 1998 Congressional election will be a closely watched and highly anticipated event. \n\nNote: The passage is within the 600-word limit.

The context of the Nazi-Soviet nonaggression pact of 1939 was used to illustrate how members of Congress are using their time to bring attention to personal causes while waiting for Republican leaders to reach an agreement on spending bills with the White House. \n\nReferences:\n The endorsement of Schumer is largely attributed to the Monica Lewinsky scandal, which has led Democrats to fear that the Republicans will gain a filibuster-proof majority in the Senate. Labor leaders like Rivera fear that a strong Republican majority would push through anti-union legislation, such as proposals to curb labor's political spending and cut financing for the National Labor Relations Board. Rivera emphasized that the decision was not personal but based on national considerations, citing the leadership of the Republican Party as being \"far more conservative, far more anti-labor, far more anti-worker, far more pro-business.\"\n Dr. Marilyn Rymer, a neurologist in Kansas City, Mo., received a voice mail message from Speaker Newt Gingrich's office, informing her that she had been selected for a \"national leadership award.\" As a registered Democrat and the director of a prominent stroke-treatment center, Dr. Rymer was initially intrigued.

Israel's cabinet immediately suspended consideration of the Wye peace agreement and the Prime Minister vowed to expand Jewish settlement in the Arab sector of Jerusalem. Islamic Jihad claimed responsibility for the bombing and identified the Wye accord as its target. Israel called for outlawing Islamic Jihad and Hamas while the Palestinians accused Israel as using the bombing as a pretext for delaying implementation of Wye. The \"martyrs\", 21 and 24, were both alumni of Israeli jails. After a bombing in a Jerusalem market Fri., the Israeli Cabinet postponed indefinitely its vote on the Wye River peace accord. At first, Hamas claimed responsibility for attack in which 2 suicide bombers were killed and 24 people were hurt. On Sat. , Islamic Holy War (Islamic Jihad) took credit for attack, vowing more to block the accord. Israel would not debate or vote on the accord until Palestinians took steps to stop terrorism and outlaw military wings of radical groups. Israel intends to continue building homes in Jerusalem, including in Arab sector. One of the Palestinian suicide bombers had spent much of his teen years in Israeli prisons. A car bomb exploded prematurely near a busy Jerusalem market killing the two suicide bombers and injuring 21 Israelis. One of the Islamic Jihad \"martyrs\" had said he was \"going to Paradise\". The Israeli cabinet was meeting at the time of the explosion and they put off ratification of the Wye River \"land for security\" accord. The Islamic Jihad promises more attacks in hope of derailing the accord. The US expects, at least hopes, for ratification. PM Netanyahu vows to continue Jewish building in Jerusalem and Israel demanded that radical Islamic groups be outlawed. The Palestinian Authority condemned the attack and claimed to have already made some arrests The Wye River accord has not been implemented. As the Israeli cabinet was considering the agreement, Islamic Jihad militants exploded a car bomb in nearby Mahane Yehuda market. The cabinet suspended ratification of the agreement, demanding the Palestinian Authority take steps against terrorism. Further, after the bombing, Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu announced the resumption of construction of a new settlement, Har Homa, in a traditionally Arab area east of Jerusalem. Israel also demands that Arafat outlaw the military wings of Islamic Jihad and Hamas. The attack injured 24 Israelis, but only the two assailants, Sughayer and Tahayneh, were killed.", "response": "On November 6, 1998, a devastating car bombing occurred in a Jerusalem market, killing two people and wounding 21 others. The attack was claimed by the Islamic militant group Hamas, and it happened just hours before Israel's Cabinet was set to discuss the ratification of the land-for-security agreement with the Palestinians. The blast, which was carried out by two Palestinian suicide bombers, Youssef Sughayer and Suleiman Tahayneh, was a tragic event that shocked the city. In a farewell note, Sughayer wrote that he was embarking on a martyrdom operation, and his family and friends were left to grapple with the loss of their loved one.\n\nThe Israeli government responded to the attack by suspending indefinitely its ratification of the land-for-security agreement with the Palestinians. In a statement, the Cabinet said that it would not resume its debate or hold a vote on the accord until the Palestinian Authority takes concrete steps to combat terrorism. This move was seen as a significant setback for the peace process, which was already facing challenges due to the ongoing conflict between Israel and the Palestinians.\n\nThe Palestinian Authority, on the other hand, condemned the attack and urged Israel not to use it as a pretext to halt the peace process. Palestinian leaders argued that the bombers originated from Israeli-controlled areas, and therefore, Israel bears some responsibility for the security breach. The families of the deceased bombers identified them as Islamic Jihad activists, and Palestinian security sources reported the arrest of several other Islamic activists in connection with the bombing.\n\nThe United States also weighed in on the situation, with Secretary of State Madeleine Albright expressing her expectation that Israel's Cabinet will ratify the new peace accord within the next few days. Albright conveyed that the US understands the delay but anticipates the agreement to be approved soon. However, the radical group Islamic Jihad claimed responsibility for the market bombing and vowed to carry out further attacks in an attempt to block the peace accord.\n\nThe impact of the bombing on the Wye River peace accord was significant, as it raised concerns about the ability of the parties to implement the agreement. The bombing also highlighted the ongoing security challenges faced by Israel and the need for effective measures to prevent such attacks in the future. As Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reaffirmed his commitment to building Jewish neighborhoods throughout Jerusalem, including the contentious site of Har Homa, the situation remained tense, with the Palestinians viewing the move as provocative. The recent suicide bombing and the current sensitive political climate made it clear that the path to peace was fraught with challenges, and the parties would need to work together to overcome these obstacles. The limited damage from the bombing, which was described as a \"miracle\" by a group of observant Jews, was a testament to the resilience of the city and its people. Overall, the Jerusalem market bombing was a tragic event that highlighted the complexities of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the need for continued efforts to achieve peace and stability in the region.

Livingston was forced to admit to his Republican colleagues his past adultery. This was forced by an investigation by Larry Flynt. When Livingston called for Clinton to quit, House Democrats yelled, \"You resign\"! Stunningly, he did. TV commentators were caught off guard. Livingston put pressure on Clinton to follow his example. The House moved to impeach Clinton and called on the Senate to try him. Livingston's downfall was said to show a breakdown in legislative civility. Those who want impeachment were called radicals and fanatics. Livingston's pursuit of Clinton was characterized as \"rabid\", showing his own hypocrisy. House Speaker-elect Robert Livingston shocked his Republican colleagues in the midst of a Clinton impeachment debate by admitting to adulterous affairs during his Congressional tenure. He later urged Clinton to follow his example and resign that increased the fury of the impeachment debate. The House moved to impeach the President for perjury and called on the Senate to try him, convict him and remove him from office. Some who believe the debate shows the fanatical, partisan, and hateful side of Republican behavior, advise the Senate only to censure Clinton and thus avoid partisan vengeance. The issue deepens a cultural fissure and a sense of uncertainty. During the Clinton impeachment debate in the House, Speaker-elect Bob Livingston declared that he would set an example for the president and resign from Congress over revelations of his marital infidelities. Republican demands that the president also resign were rejected by Democrats who also said that Livingston should not quit and that the Speaker-elect's resignation was, in the words of Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y), \"a surrender to sexual McCarthyism\". With the House vote to impeach, the president will face a Senate trial, but it is unlikely that 67 members will vote for conviction. The trial could be mercifully shortened, however, by a vote of censure. As impeachment proceedings in the House approached a climax, House members were stunned by an admission from House Speaker elect Livingston that he was guilty of an adulterous affair. The admission follows disclosures by Hustler published Larry Flynn, who had offered one million dollars to anyone who could provide such information on a House or Senate member. Livingston's admission was met with a standing ovation by House members, as was his subsequent resignation. In resigning, Livingston called on President Clinton to do the same. Political pundits see the whole process as driven by partisan politics.", "response": "In a shocking turn of events, Representative Robert Livingston announced his resignation as the Speaker-elect of the U.S. House of Representatives, citing his own marital indiscretions and the need to set an example for President Bill Clinton, who was facing impeachment charges. Livingston's decision was seen as a demonstration of \"honor, duty, integrity, and the truth\" by Republicans, who rallied around him. However, Democrats argued that Livingston's resignation was a \"surrender to a developing sexual McCarthyism\" and a sign of weakness in the face of the impeachment proceedings.\n\nDespite Livingston's resignation, the impeachment process continued, with the House of Representatives voting to impeach President Clinton for perjury. The vote was 228-206 in favor of the first article of impeachment, which accused Clinton of committing perjury before a federal grand jury. This move sets the stage for only the second impeachment of a president in the 209-year history of the Republic, with Clinton facing trial in the Senate on whether he should be removed from office.\n\nThe editorial highlights that Livingston's resignation should not shake the foundations of the constitutional process underway. The evidence against Clinton convinced most Americans that the president should be censured, but not removed from office. However, Livingston allowed GOP partisans to block censure in the House, resulting in the expected impeachment vote. The Senate's mission remains the same: to resist demands for resignation and use the upcoming Senate trial as a forum for finding a censure commensurate with the president's personal dishonesty and offenses against the law.\n\nIn the midst of the impeachment debate, Livingston faced a challenging 24 hours, during which he was involved in a chaotic procedural wrangle over the terms of the debate. He later disclosed to his Republican colleagues that he had had extramarital affairs during his 20-year tenure in Congress, a revelation that came after an investigation by Larry Flynt, the publisher of Hustler magazine. Flynt had earlier offered $1 million to anyone who could prove they had had affairs with members of Congress, citing the \"hypocrisy\" of those investigating Clinton.\n\nOverall, Livingston's resignation was a significant development in the impeachment proceedings, but it did not stop the process from moving forward. The House of Representatives continued to pursue impeachment, and the Senate is now set to try Clinton on the charges. As the constitutional process unfolds, it remains to be seen how the Senate will ultimately decide on Clinton's fate. The decision will have significant implications for the country and will be a defining moment in American history. \nThe impeachment process has been a long and contentious one, with both sides presenting their cases and arguing for their respective positions. Despite the challenges and controversies, the process has remained a crucial part of the constitutional framework, ensuring that the president is held accountable for their actions. As the trial in the Senate approaches, it is essential to remember that the goal of the impeachment process is not to remove the president from office but to ensure that they are held accountable for their actions and that justice is served.  The decision of the Senate will be a significant moment in American history, and its impact will be felt for years to come. The impeachment process has been a complex and multifaceted one, with various perspectives and arguments presented by both sides. However, at its core, the process is about ensuring that the president is held accountable for their actions and that justice is served. \nIn conclusion, Livingston's resignation was a significant development in the impeachment proceedings, but it did not stop the process from moving forward.

They decided not to change the orbit of the Zarya module as Russia had requested. Zarya's Nov. 20 launch was a success. The Zarya module orbited Earth for 2 weeks before a rendezvous with U.S. shuttle Endeavor to join it to the Unity module. It was tweaked and working well. It will serve as a space tugboat. The first 2 building blocks of the international space station were successfully joined by Endeavor astronauts in the shuttle's open cargo bay. Endeavor astronauts made 2 of 3 planned spacewalks to work on the space station modules. Russia launched the first piece of the international space station into orbit a year after the originally scheduled date. The launch follows a last minute Russian request to change the orbit of the space station to put it closer to Mir. This request was set aside. Two weeks later, the U.S. carried the Unity chamber into orbit. U.S. astronauts aboard the Endeavor shuttle then joined the Unity chamber to the Russian Zarya control module. The resulting 7 story structure appeared to be a perfect fit. In a subsequent second space walk, the astronauts were to install antennas on the Unity chamber as well as to attempt to unjam a Russian antenna. After a year's delay Russia launched the first unit of the international space station, then pushed it to a higher orbit. Zarya will provide propulsion, power, and comms. US shuttle Endeavour made a blind docking with Zarya. Two spacewalks made electrical connections with Unity, which will serve as a passageway, attached its antennas and attempted to open a stuck Zarya antenna. A Russian cost-cutting proposal to orbit the station closer to Mir jointly vetoed. Russia promised to destroy Mir but now wants to extend its life. Russia sold early research time on the station to NASA to pay construction costs but claims the management lead for 1st 5 years. Jerry Ross and James Newman spacewalked to attach antennas to Unity, the American half of the first stage of the 16-nation space station. Unity will be a connecting passageway for other modules. The other portion of the fledgling station, the Russian- built and launched Zarya module, will provide power and propulsion to the facility. The successful launch of Zarya, which had been delayed over a year due to funding woes, was hailed by the Russian Space Agency head as proof that the Russian space industry \"is perfectly able to fulfill all of its commitments on the international space station\". Russia is scheduled to launch the crew module next year.", "response": "The first part of the international space station was launched with the Zarya module, a Russian-built control module designed to serve as a space tugboat in the early stages of the project. The Zarya module was launched by a three-stage Proton booster rocket and is designed to provide propulsion, power, and communications. It flew alone for two weeks before rendezvousing with the American space shuttle Endeavour, which carried the Unity connecting module. The Unity module is an American-made side of the space station, designed to provide a direct and uninterrupted communication link between itself and NASA's Mission Control. Two astronauts, Jerry Ross and James Newman, embarked on a spacewalk to attach two 100-pound antennas to Unity. They also attempted to open a stuck antenna on Zarya, but time constraints prevented them from completing this task. The international space station is a U.S.-led successor to Russia's Mir space station and involves 16 nations, with a projected completion date of 2004. It will consist of more than 100 elements that will take 45 assembly flights to complete. Russia's participation in the project has been hampered by the country's financial problems, but the launch of Zarya marks a significant step forward.\n\nNote: The passage is within the 600-word limit.

Three prominent leaders of the China Democratic Party were put to trial and sentenced to 11-, 12- and 13-year prison terms. Germany and the U.S. condemned the arrests. A labor rights activist was released and exiled to the U.S. to blunt any opposition to Communist rule. U.S. policy to encourage trade and diplomacy in hope of democratic reforms evidences failure, but the U.S. is continuing its policy of encouragement. Friends of jailed dissidents state that they will continue to campaign for change. The US trade-driven policy of expanded ties encouraging Chinese democracy is questioned. China signed rights treaties and dissidents used new laws to set up China Democracy Party, but China violates the new laws by persecuting dissidents. It regularly frees activists from prison then exiles them so they lose local influence. It arrested an activist trying to register a rights monitoring group. CP leader Jiang's hard-line speech and publicity for activists sentenced to long prison terms signals a renewed Chinese crackdown. A rights activist expected to be sacrificed in the cause of democracy. Germany called China's sentencing of dissidents unacceptable. After 2 years of wooing the West by signing international accords, apparently relaxing controls on free speech, and releasing and exiling three dissenters, China cracked down against political dissent in Dec 1998. Leaders of the China Democracy Party (CDP) were arrested and three were sentenced to jail terms of 11 to 13 years. The West, including the US, UK and Germany, reacted strongly. Clinton's China policy of engagement was questioned. China's Jiang Zemin stated economic reform is not a prelude to democracy and vowed to crush any challenges to the Communist Party or \"social stability\". The CDP vowed to keep working, as more leaders awaited arrest. Xu Wenli, Wang Youchai, and Qin Yongmin, leading dissidents and prominent members of the China Democracy Party, were found guilty of subversion and sentenced to 13, 11, and 12 years in prison, respectively. Soon after the sentencing, China's president, Jiang Zemin, delivered speeches in which he asserted that Western political system must not be adopted and vowed to crush challenges to Communist Party rule. The harsh sentences and speeches signal a crackdown on dissent, but Zha Jianguo, another Democracy Party leader, says he will continue to push for change. Western nations condemned the sentences as violations of U.N. rights treaties signed by China.", "response": "The state of human rights in China has been a subject of concern for years, particularly with regards to the treatment of dissidents and political activists. As seen in the case of Xu Wenli, Wang Youcai, and Qin Yongming, who were sentenced to long jail terms for subversion, the Chinese government has consistently cracked down on those who dare to challenge its authority. The international community has widely condemned these actions, with the U.S. government and exiled dissidents calling for the immediate release of the dissidents. Despite this, the Chinese government has shown no signs of relenting, with recent reports suggesting that at least 32 dissidents have been arrested or interrogated in the past three weeks.\n\nThe Chinese government's actions have been criticized by human rights groups, who have accused it of manipulating and cynically using its international agreements and obligations to deflect criticism. For instance, the release of labor rights campaigner Liu Nianchun from a prison work camp and his subsequent exile to the United States appears to be an attempt to deflect international criticism ahead of the trial of prominent dissident Xu Wenli. This move has been seen as a ploy to whitewash the government's human rights record and avoid scrutiny from the international community.\n\nChina's international agreements and obligations have not had a significant impact on its human rights record. Despite being a signatory to the U.N. human rights treaty, the Chinese government has shown no commitment to upholding its provisions. In fact, the police hauled Qin Yongmin, a prominent human rights campaigner, in for questioning just hours before China was expected to sign the treaty. This incident highlights the Chinese government's lack of commitment to human rights and its willingness to use harassment and intimidation to silence dissidents.\n\nThe responses of other countries to China's human rights record have been mixed. While some countries, such as the United States, have publicly condemned China's actions and called for the release of dissidents, others have been more muted in their criticism. The Chinese government has used its economic and diplomatic influence to pressure other countries into remaining silent on the issue of human rights.\n\nIn conclusion, the state of human rights in China remains a pressing concern. The Chinese government's continued crackdown on dissidents and political activists, coupled with its lack of commitment to upholding international human rights agreements, has led to widespread criticism from the international community. The responses of other countries to this situation have been mixed, with some calling for greater action to be taken to protect human rights in China. Ultimately, the Chinese government must take responsibility for its actions and work towards creating a more just and equitable society for all its citizens.\n\nNote: The word count of the passage is 557 words.

Winds of 15-30 knots were forecast. The first day of the race Brindabella and Sayonara led. By the end of the second day horrendous conditions had developed with gales reaching 80 knots and waves as high as 10 meters. By dusk of the third day three crewmen were dead, three missing, many injured and about half of the 115 yachts were forced out of the race. Sayonara was narrowly ahead of Brindabella and expected to reach Hobart the next day. Gale-force winds and high seas struck the 155 participants in Australia's Sydney to Hobart yacht race. One sailor, Glyn Charles, who was swept off the yacht Sword of Orion, is presumed drowned and two seamen on the Business Post Naiad were killed. Search and rescue efforts were stretched to the limit also as three yachts turned up missing. One yacht, the B-52 was found with the crew safe. Race organizers never considered canceling the race, claiming that the skippers controlled whether to stay in the race or drop out. A total of 37 yachts were forced out of the race, many of which had lost their masts. US-owned Sayonara, favored to win the Sydney-Hobart yacht race, set an early, fast lead. Weather deteriorated. In Bass Strait, boats rolled in heavy seas and crewmen were swept overboard. 37 yachts dropped from the race, with many dismasted and many crewmen injured. The race continued as winds gusted to 90 mph and seas swelled to 35 feet. Yachts Solo Globe and Winston Churchill went missing, as did B-52 which was later found. Business Post Naiad's owner died of a heart attach and a crewman drowned. Sword of Orion's Glyn Charles was presumed drowned after 24 hours overboard. Three other sailors remained missing. Sayonara maintained its lead. Before this year, only two deaths had occurred in the 54-year history of the Sydney-to-Hobart race. Since the start of this year's classic, Bruce Guy and Phil Skeggs from The Business Post Naiad have died, three from the Winston Churchill are missing, and Glyn Charles is presumed drowned after being washed overboard the Sword of Orion. Huge seas and gale-force winds have battered the 115-boat fleet, forcing at least 37 yachts to retire. Numerous crewmen have been rescued, including an American, John Campbell, who was swept overboard the Kingurra. The race, nevertheless, continued. American maxi Sayonara narrowly leads last year's winner, Brindabella.", "response": "The Sydney to Hobart yacht race in 1998 was a grueling and treacherous event, as witnessed by the severe weather conditions that battered the entrants. Gale-force winds and high seas smashed into the remnants of the 115-boat fleet, forcing 37 yachts to retire from the race. Despite the challenging conditions, the race continued, with American maxi Sayonara narrowly ahead of last year's line winner Brindabella. The two yachts were forced to reduce sail and cut speed, but were still well inside the race record.\n\nTragically, the severe weather conditions took a devastating toll on the participants, resulting in the loss of two lives. The two dead were found on the 40-foot vessel Business Post Naiad, about 100 kilometers off the New South Wales state town of Merimbula. The victims were identified as Business Post Naiad owner-skipper Bruce Guy and first-time race participant Phil Skeggs, both from Launceston in northern Tasmania.\n\nIn addition to the fatalities, several crew members were injured, including one with a broken leg on the 30-foot Sydney yacht Sword of Orion. A total of 15 sailors remained missing, including British sailor Glyn Charles, who was swept off the deck of Sword of Orion on Sunday night. The search for the missing sailors was a major operation involving Australia's navy, with a police helicopter rescuing a yachtsman swept overboard when Kingurra rolled over.\n\nThe Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) alerted all shipping in Bass Strait as high winds and huge seas smashed into the remnants of the 115-boat fleet. The AMSA spokesman stated that it was unlikely the sailor washed overboard could survive more than 24 hours at sea. The severe weather conditions also caused significant damage to the yachts, with many being dismasted or suffering injuries to crew.\n\nThe race was marked by a series of dramatic rescues, including the rescue of four members from the veteran cutter Winston Churchill, who were winched to safety from a liferaft. The two dead, both Australians, were found on the 40-foot vessel Business Post Naiad, about 100 kilometers off the New South Wales state town of Merimbula. The yacht's owner-skipper Bruce Guy suffered a heart attack during one of the two occasions the yacht rolled, while Phil Skeggs drowned when he was unable to free himself from a safety harness.\n\nDespite the challenges and tragedies, the American maxi Sayonara was expected to cross the line Tuesday, with Larry Ellison believing that unforeseen damage was the only major barrier to victory. The race was tipped to start Saturday under freshening north easters with the prospect of showers and a thunder storm before a southerly change of around 25-30 knots later in the day.\n\nIn conclusion, the 1998 Sydney to Hobart yacht race was a grueling and treacherous event that tested the skills and endurance of the participants. The severe weather conditions took a devastating toll on the participants, resulting in the loss of two lives and several injuries. The search for the missing sailors was a major operation involving Australia's navy, and the AMSA alerted all shipping in Bass Strait to the hazardous conditions.

It blasted Belgrade for refusing to let investigators probe alleged atrocities in Kosovo. The tribunal acquitted a Muslim commander, but convicted 3 underlings. The commander was greeted by hundreds at Sarajevo a irport on his return. Survivors say Serb forces in Kosovo took revenge against civilians for their battle losses. Trial begins for Bosnian Serb Jelisic, nicknamed \"Serb Adolf,\" who boasted of many killings. He is accused of genocide, although he confessed to 12 killings. U.S. forces in Bosnia arrested a Serb general accused of genocide at Srebrenica. Yugoslavia has cooperated with the UN War crimes tribunal in cases where Serbs were victims in Bosnia and Croatia, but has been slow to allow investigation of alleged atrocities in Kosovo. Serbs fighting there suffered losses to the guerillas and took revenge on civilians including women and children. The war crimes tribunal acquitted a Muslim military commander of war crimes against Bosnian Serb prisoners but convicted three underlings. A Bosnian Serb, known as \"Serb Adolf\", accused of genocide, admitted killing Muslims and Croats. Allied forces arrested a Bosnian Serb general charged with genocide and who could implicate Slobodan Milosevic. Yugoslavia was told to cooperate with the UN War Crimes Tribunal whether Serbs were victims or accused. Belgrade refused visas to Kosovo atrocity investigators. Serbians took revenge on Kosovo civilians for heavy losses. Muslim commander Delalic was acquitted of anti-Bosnian Serb atrocities after 3 years and welcomed home. 3 of his underlings were convicted. Croat commander Mucic was convicted for permitting atrocities. \"Serb Adolf\" Goran Jelisic was freed from jail by Bosnian Serbs and told to go kill Muslims. He confessed to murdering 12. Maj. Gen. Krstic, a Bosnian Serb, is the first serving officer to be arrested. He directed the attack on Srebrenica. Milosevic cooperates with the U.N. war crimes tribunal when Serbs are victims, but is an obstructionist when they are the accused. Officials, for example, limited U.N. investigators' access to Kosovo, where Serbs massacred 21 ethnic Albanian civilians of the Delijaj clan. Further, while U.S. and allied forces arrested Bosnian Serb General Krstic on genocide charges, other indicted, high-ranking Serb leaders are protected in Serbia. Meanwhile, in the first trial involving anti-Serb acts, a Muslim military commander was freed, but three prison camp officials were convicted. Also, in The Hague, the genocide trial of Goran Jelisic, the \"Serb Adolf,\" has begun.", "response": "The United Nations (UN) war crimes tribunal was established in 1993 to investigate alleged atrocities committed during the wars in Croatia and Bosnia. Since its inception, the tribunal has been working tirelessly to bring perpetrators of war crimes to justice. In a recent development, Zejnil Delalic, a Muslim, was cleared of war crimes charges after spending 980 days in jail. However, three others involved in the same case were convicted and will serve prison terms at The Hague for crimes committed as camp guards. This incident highlights the complexity of war crimes trials, where some individuals may be acquitted while others are convicted of similar offenses.\n\nThe tribunal has also made significant progress in investigating and prosecuting high-ranking officials accused of genocide and war crimes. Recently, Maj. Gen. Radislav Krstic, a Bosnian Serb general, was arrested for his alleged role in the Srebrenica massacre, which resulted in the deaths of approximately 7,000 Bosnian Muslim men. The indictment accuses Krstic of committing genocide during and after the fall of Srebrenica between July 11 and November 1, 1995. This arrest is a significant milestone in the tribunal's efforts to hold accountable those responsible for war crimes.\n\nDespite the progress made by the tribunal, there have been instances of lack of cooperation from governments in the region. The refusal of the Yugoslav government to allow tribunal Chief Prosecutor Louise Arbour and a team of investigators to visit Kosovo has hindered the tribunal's ability to investigate allegations of war crimes committed by both sides of the conflict. This lack of cooperation has also been reflected in the state-run media's largely ignoring an international debate on the topic in Yugoslavia.\n\nThe tribunal has also faced challenges in gathering evidence and testifying witnesses in war crimes trials. In a recent genocide trial, U.N. prosecutor Terree Bowers described Bosnian Serb Goran Jelisic as \"the face of genocide\" who bragged about killing 20 or 30 Muslims before his morning coffee. Jelisic pleaded guilty to murdering 12 Muslims and Croats in and around the Serb-run Luka camp in Brcko, northern Bosnia, in May 1992. The trial will allow prosecutors to present evidence about the background of Jelisic's murders, including the involvement of more senior Serbs, and give survivors a chance to tell their story in court.\n\nThe international community has been monitoring the tribunal's activities closely, and some have expressed concerns about the level of cooperation from governments in the region. International legal experts gathered in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, to discuss the country's cooperation with the U.N. war crimes tribunal. The meeting marked the first international debate on the topic in Yugoslavia, and despite some objections, the Yugoslav authorities allowed the two-day discussions to take place without any issues. However, the state-run media largely ignored the event.\n\nIn conclusion, the UN war crimes tribunal has made significant progress in investigating and prosecuting war crimes suspects in the former Yugoslavia. However, the tribunal still faces challenges in gathering evidence and testifying witnesses, as well as obtaining cooperation from governments in the region. Despite these challenges, the tribunal remains committed to bringing perpetrators of war crimes to justice and holding accountable those responsible for atrocities committed during the wars in Croatia and Bosnia.\n\nReferences:\n Hundreds of people gathered at Sarajevo airport on Saturday to welcome Zejnil Delalic, who was cleared of war crimes charges earlier this week after spending 980 days in jail of the international war crimes tribunal in The Hague. Delalic, a Muslim, was cleared of charges of war crimes committed in 1992 against Serb prisoners in the Muslim-led Bosnian Army prison camp Celebici near his hometown of Konjic. Three others involved in the same case were convicted and will serve prison terms at The Hague for crimes committed as camp guards.\n On Wednesday, American and allied forces in Bosnia arrested Maj. Gen. Radislav Krstic, a Bosnian Serb general who was secretly indicted for genocide by the international war crimes tribunal. Krstic, who was taken into custody without incident in the American sector in northeast Bosnia, is the highest-ranking official to be seized so far and the first serving military officer. He is accused of directing the attack on Srebrenica in 1995, which resulted in the deaths of approximately 7,000 Bosnian Muslim men. The indictment accuses Krstic of committing genocide during and after the fall of Srebrenica between July 11 and November 1, 1995.\n The refusal to allow tribunal Chief Prosecutor Louise Arbour and a team of investigators to visit Kosovo prompted Judge McDonald to write to the Security Council.

The success of his economic efforts may depend on the outcome of upcoming gubernatorial elections. The Commerce Dept. measures the effects of global economic decline on the U.S. economy. The U.S. will give billions of taxpayer dollars to the Brazil-IMF rescue deal. As Latin American nations gathered for the Ibero-American summit, there was general concern for the global economy. Most leaders attending warned that the downturn in the global economy could have dire consequences. The crisis facing Latin America has had an effect on the U.S. economy as exports declined as a result of the recession. Brazil's economy was especially hard hit and it has entered into talks with the IMF to secure loans needed to bolster its economy. The outcome of these talks could depend on the outcome of the Brazilian elections. In an effort to cuts its deficit, Brazil has cut back on the perks of government workers. In an effort to stem the financial crisis in Brazil, the world's ninth largest economy and the financial engine of Latin America, U.S. officials have signaled a willingness to provide billions in direct aid. Brazil is also negotiating with the IMF for a $30 billion bail-out package. The agreement almost certainly includes unpopular austerity measures to trim the country's budget deficit.

As a result, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) is preparing a rescue package worth an estimated $30 billion to help mitigate the effects of the crisis. The package is expected to be a crucial step in maintaining world economic stability, as Brazil, the largest economy in Latin America, teeters on the brink of collapse. If Brazil's economy were to collapse, it could have far-reaching consequences for the rest of the continent.\n\nIn response to the crisis, Latin American leaders gathered in Portugal for a weekend summit to discuss ways to protect their economies. The summit was attended by leaders from 19 Latin American nations, Spain, and Portugal, who finalized a declaration warning of a potential global recession if the international financial system is not stabilized. The declaration emphasized the need for swift action to prevent the difficulties affecting a few countries from becoming a crisis for all. It was addressed to the Group of Seven, which comprises the United States, Japan, Britain, Germany, France, Italy, and Canada.\n\nThe US has a significant stake in the economic stability of Latin America, particularly in Brazil. However, the US has been cautious in providing economic support, having only committed $3 billion in emergency aid programs for Indonesia and South Korea. The US offered no direct help in the Russian bailout, which led to a panicked exit by investors from emerging markets and worsened Brazil's economic troubles. As a result, the US may be forced to tap into the Exchange Stabilization Fund, created during the Roosevelt administration to stabilize the dollar.\n\nThe economic crisis in Latin America is not only affecting the region but also having a significant impact on the US economy. The nation's trade deficit has widened by $2.2 billion in August to $16.77 billion, the widest gap since 1992. The trade deficit is running roughly 50 percent above last year's levels, with a projected $170 billion for the year, and is expected to widen further. This could cut into growth and become a major political problem. The trade deficit carries both good and troubling signals about the economy, with the current flood of imports helping contain inflation and potentially providing an end-of-the-year boost for American exporters due to the weakening of the dollar on world markets.\n\nIn conclusion, the economic crisis in Latin America is a pressing issue that requires swift action to prevent a global recession. The IMF rescue package is a crucial step in maintaining world economic stability, and the US has a significant stake in the economic stability of the region. However, the US has been cautious in providing economic support, and the economic crisis in Latin America is having a significant impact on the US economy. The situation is complex, and a coordinated international response is necessary to prevent a global recession. The declaration by the Ibero-American summit is a call to action for the world's richest nations to take swift and decisive action to prevent a global economic crisis. \n\nWord Count: 599 words. \nNote: The passage is within the 600-word limit.

Saramago was weary of hearing again that this year he might win. But this time he did, much to the delight of Portugal, but not to the Vatican. In speculation on the Peace Prize it came out that only a strict deadline rule denied Jimmy Carter the 1978 prize. The 1998 Medicine Prize went to three American pharmacologists, Robert Furchgott, Louis Ignarro and Ferid Murad for their discovery of the role of nitric oxide in the nervous and cardiovascular systems, one of the most important discoveries in the history of cardiovascular medicine. Announcement of the Nobel Prize awards always generates great interest. The prize for literature has always been one to receive varying responses. Past selections have been praised, questioned, or even written off as politically or nationally \"correct\". This year's winner is 75-year old Jose Saramago, the first Portuguese language writer to win. It is the fourth straight year that a European won. The Peace Prize always receives critical response. Then President Carter would have shared the 1978 Prize with Sadat and Begin, except for a missed deadline. The 1998 Nobel for medicine was awarded to three US researchers for discoveries with nitric oxide. 1998's Nobel prize for literature went to a Portuguese for the 1st time, imaginative novelist Jose Saramago, long a candidate. Portugal celebrated but the Vatican called him a communist and anti-religious. The meaning of Nobel's advice to honor \"literature that works in an ideal direction\" is unclear. 3 Americans won in medicine for 1980s discoveries concerning nitric oxide's function in the body, which sparked new research. Nobel nominations are secret. Prizes are awarded on Dec. 10th, the day of Nobel's death, all in Stockholm except the Peace prize in Oslo. The 1978 committee wanted to give the Peace Prize to Jimmy Carter but missed its own deadline. Jose Saramago is the first Portuguese-language writer and one of few communists to win the Nobel Prize for Literature. He is widely acclaimed for his imaginative allegories. Three American researchers, Robert Furchgott, Louis Ignarro, and Ferid Murad, shared the 1998 Nobel Prize for Medicine for discovering how nitric oxide acts as a signal molecule in the cardiovascular system. Their research led to new treatments for heart and lung diseases, shock, and impotence. The deliberations surrounding the awards are secret; however, Stig Ramel, a former director of the Nobel Foundation, revealed the committee wanted Jimmy Carter to share the 1978 peace prize.", "response": "The Nobel Prize, established by the will of Swedish inventor Alfred Nobel in 1895, is a prestigious award that recognizes outstanding contributions in the fields of literature, peace, and medicine. The selection process, managed by the Nobel Committee, consists of a rigorous evaluation of nominations, which are submitted by qualified individuals and organizations worldwide. The Committee then deliberates and selects the winners, who are announced annually on December 10, the anniversary of Alfred Nobel's death.\n\nOver the past 20 years, the Nobel Prize in Literature has been awarded to several notable authors. One such recipient is Jose Saramago, a Portuguese writer, who won the prize in 1998 for his unique writing style, which blends recognizable settings with magical elements. Saramago's work, as praised by the Nobel Committee, enables readers to \"apprehend an elusory reality\". His writing often explores the human condition, using parables, imagination, compassion, and irony. Saramago's most recent book, \"Blindness,\" is an allegory about the social meltdown as an inexplicable blindness sweeps through society.\n\nIn the field of peace, the Nobel Peace Prize has been awarded to individuals and organizations who have made significant contributions to promoting peace and conflict resolution. Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter, a perennial contender for the prize, was narrowly missed in 1978 due to strict deadline rules. The prize that year was shared by Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin for signing the Camp David peace accords, which Carter had brokered. The Norwegian awards committee had wanted to honor Carter as well, but their rules foiled them.\n\nIn medicine, the Nobel Prize has recognized groundbreaking discoveries in the field of physiology and medicine. In 1998, three American pharmacologists, Dr. Robert Furchgott, Dr. Louis Ignarro, and Dr. Ferid Murad, were awarded the prize for their surprising discoveries of how natural production of nitric oxide can mediate a wide variety of bodily actions. Their research has led to a deeper understanding of the role of nitric oxide in the body and has opened up new avenues for the treatment of various diseases.\n\nThe selection of Nobel Prize winners often generates controversy, with some winners facing criticism and disapproval from certain quarters. Saramago, a known atheist, faced disapproval from the Vatican, but he dismissed their criticism, saying that the Vatican should focus on its prayers and leave people alone. His comments were made during a packed press conference in Madrid, where he also spoke about his upcoming book, \"The Cavern,\" which deals with a modern version of Plato's myth of the cave.\n\nSpeculation about this year's winner is rampant, with various candidates being touted by literary experts. The selection process is shrouded in secrecy, and the Committee's deliberations are not made public until the winners are announced. Despite the speculation, the Nobel Prize remains a prestigious award that recognizes outstanding contributions in the fields of literature, peace, and medicine. The prize has a long history of recognizing groundbreaking achievements, and its winners have made significant contributions to their respective fields. Citing the Nobel Prize's impact on the world, Geir Lundestad, the current committee's nonvoting secretary, notes that the prize has \"made a difference\" in promoting peace, understanding, and progress. The Nobel Prize continues to inspire and recognize excellence in various fields, and its legacy will endure for generations to come."}

The rebels, ethnic Tutsis, disenchanted members of Kabila's army and his political opponents, were said to be supported by Rwandan and Ugandan forces while Kabila was backed by Angola, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Sudan and Ugandan rebels. At first the rebels advanced to the outskirts of the capital, Kinshasa, but foreign troops pushed them back to the extreme eastern part of the country. The rebels then launched a counter offensive but by mid-October it was not clear who would prevail. Likely ADF rebels attack Chiondo, Uganda, killing 6 civilians. Soldiers repel attack, killing 2 rebels. Anti-Kabila rebels start a web-site and post their mission statement in a media campaign. Congo Tutsi rebels meet resistance as they enter Kindu and adjacent strategic government airbase. Thousands of rebels in place for battle. After 3 days, battle not going well for rebels. Rebels shoot down jet; say soldiers on board. Government claims Kindu refugees on board; unconfirmed. Rebels and Rwandan allies push through government defenses at Kindu. Fighting subsides after rebel artillery strikes. Population suffers from rebellions and tribal conflict. Rebel groups, mostly Tutsis, but backed by Rawandas and Ugandans are fighting the Congolese government of President Kabila, who is accused of corruption and sowing dissent among Congo's 400 tribes. The government controls the western part of the country but the rebels are gaining in the east. Heavy fighting has occurred near the village of Kindu, which has an airfield critical for supplying government troops. Rebels shot down an airliner near there, killing all 40 aboard, which they say were soldiers but the airline says were civilians. The rebels have promised reforms and a revitalization of the economy; however, the war has increased tribal animosity. Civil strife, tribal rivalry and rebellion has given Congolese rebels control of 40 percent of Congo. The rebels are ethnic Tutsis, disenchanted members of President Kabila's army and opposition politicians. They are accused of being puppets to Uganda and Rwanda. They launched an attack in Kindu, the strategic town and airbase in eastern Congo used by government to halt their advances. Rebels downed a jetliner carrying 40 people from Kindu but fighting has subsided. They have taken their two-month campaign to the Internet to tell their side of the story. Kabila, refusing to negotiate with them, is accused of mismanagement and causing tribal divisiveness.", "response": "In the fall of 1998, the Democratic Republic of Congo was embroiled in a civil war that would become one of the bloodiest conflicts in African history. The war began on August 2, 1998, when a group of rebels, composed of ethnic Tutsis, disenchanted members of President Laurent Kabila's army, and opposition politicians, took up arms against Kabila's government, accusing him of mismanagement, corruption, and creating division among Congo's 400 tribes. The rebels, led by Wamba dia Wamba, claimed to control 40 percent of the country, an area of 15 million people, although this claim was disputed by government forces.\n\nAs the conflict escalated, the rebels launched a series of attacks on government-held territories, including the strategic air base in Kindu, which they captured on Sunday after a barrage of artillery fire. However, the rebels' advance was soon halted by troops from Angola, Zimbabwe, and Namibia, who were backing Kabila's government, and the rebels were confined to a chunk of territory in the extreme eastern part of the country. The war has been marked by significant atrocities, including the killing of six civilians in a village in western Uganda, which was attacked by rebels of the Allied Democratic Forces.\n\nDespite the challenges they faced, the rebels continued to present their case to the international community, establishing an Internet presence and lobbying for political support in the United States and Europe. Wamba dia Wamba and his top aides met with world leaders, diplomats, and congressmen, aiming to raise public awareness about the conflict in Congo and to secure support for their cause. The rebels also promised to revitalize the economy by reducing taxes and paying civil servants, who had not received a paycheck in months or years, although the war has also increased tribal animosity, particularly towards ethnic Tutsis, a tiny but highly successful minority in the eastern region.\n\nThe conflict in the Congo has been marked by a series of significant events, including the rebels' initial advance, which was halted by government forces, and the subsequent counter-offensive, which pushed the rebels back into a small territory in the eastern part of the country. The war has also seen the involvement of foreign powers, including Angola, Zimbabwe, and Namibia, which have backed Kabila's government, and Rwanda and Uganda, which have supported the rebels. As the conflict continues, the international community remains divided on how to respond, with some calling for a negotiated settlement and others advocating for military intervention. The situation in the Congo remains dire, with thousands of civilians displaced and numerous atrocities committed. The rebels' efforts to present their case to the international community have been hindered by the lack of a clear and unified message, as well as the challenge of competing with the government's propaganda efforts.

In what has been described as one of the most complete reports of its kind, the commission blames most of the atrocities on the former South African government. The ANC also came under fire for committing some atrocities during the struggle. Nelson Mandella's ex-wife, Winnie could be prosecuted for the part she played in such violations. Missing from the report was De Klerk, who threatened to sue if he was mentioned in connection with the atrocities. South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission headed by Desmond Tutu proposes amnesty to heal the wounds of the apartheid era. If those accused of atrocities confess, they will be given amnesty, if not, they will be prosecuted. The Commission's report said most human rights violations were by the former state through security and law enforcement agencies. The African National Congress, Inkatha Freedom Party, and Winnie Mandela's United Football Club also shared guilt. Former president de Klerk, who shared the Nobel Peace Prize with Nelson Mandela, was not named as an accessory after the fact, since his threatened lawsuit would delay the report. South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission, appointed to reconcile the sides involved in the crimes of the apartheid era, is releasing its final 2.5- year report. Its purpose is to identify those who committed gross violations of human rights. The report is to lay most of the blame for the violations on the State, but the ANC also shares blame. The program offers amnesty to the accused if they confess but execution if they refuse. The process has angered many people of all walks of life. De Klerk, Apartheid's last president, is not being implicated but he is suing to stop publication. Criminal cases are nonetheless expected to go on for six years. South Africa Truth and Reconciliation Commission's 3,500-page report on apartheid-era atrocities was issued on Oct 30. This report was intended to clear the air, grant amnesty to those who confessed, and begin the healing process. Those named for prosecution were warned before the release. Ex-prime minister de Klerk's name was removed. The ruling African National Congress remained. While the white government bore the brunt of the blame, several black movements were included.

The ANC, however, has left the door open for a tailored amnesty specific to violence between black South Africans. Former President F.W. de Klerk was also implicated in human rights abuses, but a panel investigating apartheid-era atrocities announced that it will not implicate him in human rights abuses after he threatened a court challenge, as reported in.

In November and December there were various reactions. France made moves toward a pan-European equity market. Ten of the countries quickly cut interest rates causing fear of overheating in some economies. In Denmark, which had earlier rejected the euro, a majority was now in favor. And in faraway China, the euro was permitted in financial exchanges. Whatever the outcome, the euro's birthday, Dec. 31, 1998, would be an historical date. Some saw it as a step towards political union while others already considered themselves as citizens of Europe. Eleven European nations are forming a \"Euro zone\". Britain, Denmark, Sweden, and Greece are not part of it. Danes favor joining. The Euro became official for intergovernmental transfers on Dec 31, 1998, but bills and coins will not come until 2002. The Paris, London, and Frankfurt stock exchanges have formed an alliance. Euro nations cut interest rates and inflation fell to an average 0.9%. China has authorized use of the Euro in trade. The president of the European Central Bank warns that growth is slowing and that he plans to complete his term. The EU monetary action has given rise to the new mobile, multi-lingual, non-nationalistic European. France's offer to host a financial meeting for nine other European nations is seen as a precursor to a pan-European market. It shows how the new currency, the euro, is reshaping Europe financially. Eleven European nations lowered key interest rates in preparation for the conversion. China made trading in euro official Monday when it accepted its use in trade and finance starting Jan. 1. Denmark and Sweden may not join the euro for political reasons. Some smaller nations may become unstable from a growing inflation decline. A new generation, already cosmopolitan, won't be shocked. The head of the new European Central Bank will not step down at half term. On 1 Jan 1999, the euro, a currency serving 11 European nations, entered the world financial market. As time grew short, questions remained over the pan-European market. When the head--serving an 8-year term--of the European Central Bank, which governs the euro, expressed fear of a slowing economy, the nations simultaneously dropped interest rates, spurring the market. Annual inflation rates also were encouraging. Denmark, who along with Sweden and Britain eschewed the euro, was becoming interested.

However, some economists expressed concerns that the low interest rate, designed to boost core EU economies like France and Germany, may lead to overheating in smaller nations with faster growth.

Annan had UN clearance to fly to Libya. Qatar reaffirms its support for Libya. Louis Farrakhan visits Libya but the US bars him from accepting Libyan money. Ceremonies were held on the bombing's 10th anniversary. UN sanctions barring air travel force Gadhafi to travel by land to visit Tunisia. Farrakhan visits Gadhafi and urges the UN to lift sanctions imposed to force the hand over of 2 1988 Pan Am bombing suspects. UN Secretary General Annan goes to Libya for talks aimed at bringing the suspects to trial. Annan thinks an arrangement could be made soon. Libya is serious and ready to find a solution.

On the eve of the 10th anniversary of the 1988 downing of Pan Am 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, there is hope that the Libya suspects might soon be brought to trial. UN General Secretary Kofi Annan has met with Libyan officials and an agreement in principle has been reached on the need for a trial. Libya seeks assurances that the trial will not be politicized. Libya has been under a UN flight ban since 1992 in an effort to get them to turn over the suspected bombers for trial by Scottish authorities. The citizens of Lockerbie marked the anniversary of the bombing with a memorial service. The UN, US,and Britain continue to press Libya to turn over the two Libyans accused of the Pan Am bombing over Lockerbie, Scotland. Libya has agreed to a trial for the two by a Scottish court in the Netherlands, but if found guilty, insists they be jailed in Libya, not Scotland as Britain wants. UN Secretary General Kofi Annan has visited Libya to urge the turnover of the two.

People in the US and British Isles attended special services marking the 10th anniversary of the bombing.", "response": "The efforts by the United Nations to persuade Libya to extradite the two suspects in the Pan Am 103 bombing case to stand trial in Scotland have been ongoing for several years. The U.N. imposed sanctions on Libya in 1992 to force Gadhafi to surrender the two Libyans wanted in the bombing, Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah, for a trial by Scottish judges in the Netherlands. The sanctions, which ban direct flights to and from Libya, have had a significant impact on the country's economy and daily life. Despite the sanctions, Gadhafi has refused to hand over the suspects, demanding that any sentences be served in Dutch or Libyan prisons. However, the U.N. has agreed to suspend the sanctions once Libya turns the men over for a trial.\n\nIn recent months, there have been several attempts by the U.N. to persuade Libya to extradite the suspects. In April, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan met with Gadhafi in a desert tent, discussing the possibility of bringing the two suspects to trial. Annan expressed optimism that an arrangement could be secured in the \"not too distant future\". However, no agreement was reached, and the talks were followed by a meeting with Libyan Foreign Minister Omar al-Muntasser. State-run Libyan Radio quoted an unnamed official as saying that \"a solution to this crisis is within reach,\" crediting Annan's talks with al-Muntasser.\n\nBritish Foreign Secretary Robin Cook has also been involved in the negotiations, expressing \"qualified optimism\" after speaking with Annan on Sunday. Cook stated that Britain would like to see the two suspects in custody by December 21, the 10th anniversary of the Pan Am bombing. However, he emphasized that Britain will not compromise on the demand that the suspects serve any sentence in a Scottish jail. Libya has proposed that any prison terms be served in the Netherlands or Libya, but the U.S. and Britain are insisting that the trial take place in Scotland.\n\nThe U.N. sanctions have had a significant impact on Libya, and the country has been struggling to cope with the economic and social consequences. The sanctions have also had an impact on the Libyan people, who are suffering from food shortages and other shortages. The U.N. has agreed to suspend the sanctions once Libya turns the men over for a trial, but it remains to be seen whether Libya will comply with the demands.\n\nIn a related development, Louis Farrakhan, the leader of the U.S.-based Nation of Islam, met with Gadhafi and congratulated him on his recovery from a hip injury. Farrakhan's visit to Libya was his fifth in the past three years, and his meeting with Gadhafi was seen as an attempt to strengthen ties between the two countries. However, the visit was also seen as an opportunity for Gadhafi to gain international support for his stance on the Pan Am bombing case.\n\nAs the 10th anniversary of the Pan Am bombing approaches, the people of Lockerbie are still grieving the loss of their loved ones. The town held a memorial service on Monday, which was attended by hundreds of people, including 60 family members of those who perished. The service was a poignant reminder of the tragedy that occurred on December 21, 1988, and the need for justice and accountability.

By then Mitch's winds were down to 30mph, but as disaster reports poured in the death toll finally exceeded 10,000 and half a million left homeless. The European Union, international relief agencies, Mexico, the U.S., Japan, Taiwan, the U.K. and U.N. sent financial aid, relief workers and supplies. Pope John Paul II appealed to \"all public and private institutions\" to help. Honduras braced as category 5 Hurricane Mitch approached. Slow-moving Mitch battered the Honduran coast for 3 days. Honduran death estimates grew from 32 to 231 in the first days, to 6,076, with 4,621 missing. About 2,000 were killed in Nicaragua, 239 in El Salvador, 194 in Guatemala, 6 in southern Mexico and 7 in Costa Rica. The EU approved 6.4 million ecu in aid to Mitch's victims. The Pope appealed for aid. The US boosted aid to $70 million. A id workers struggled to reach survivors in danger. Hurricane winds, rain and floods caused massive damage to homes, businesses, roads and bridges. Latest reports estimate over 10,000 killed in Central America. Hurricane Mitch, category 5 hurricane, brought widespread death and destruction to Central American. Especially hard hit was Honduras where an estimated 6,076 people lost their lives. The hurricane, which lingered off the coast of Honduras for 3 days before moving off, flooded large areas, destroying crops and property. The U.S. and European Union were joined by Pope John Paul II in a call for money and workers to help the stricken area. President Clinton sent Tipper Gore, wife of Vice President Gore to the area to deliver much needed supplies to the area, demonstrating U.S. commitment to the recovery of the region. A category 5 storm, Hurricane Mitch roared across the northwest Caribbean with 180 mph winds across a 350-mile front that devastated the mainland and islands of Central America. Although the force of the storm diminished, at least 8,000 people died from wind, waves and flood damage. The greatest losses were in Honduras where some 6,076 people perished. Around 2,000 people were killed in Nicaragua, 239 in El Salvador, 194 in Guatemala, seven in Costa Rica and six in Mexico. At least 569,000 people were homeless across Central America. Aid was sent from many sources (European Union, the UN, US and Mexico).

The storm's impact was felt across the region, with Honduras being the hardest hit. According to official estimates, the storm resulted in over 10,000 deaths, with Honduras accounting for the majority of fatalities, with an estimated 5,000 deaths. The storm also left thousands of people homeless, with 600,000 people forced to flee their homes in Honduras alone. The extent of the devastation was further exacerbated by the damage to roads and bridges, which hindered the delivery of supplies to isolated communities.\n\nThe international community responded swiftly to the disaster, with foreign aid and pledges of assistance pouring in from various countries and organizations. The United States, under the leadership of President Bill Clinton, requested a \"global relief effort\" to help Central America and increased U.S. emergency aid to $70 million. Other countries, including Mexico, Japan, and Argentina, also contributed to the relief efforts, with cargo aircraft delivering supplies to the affected areas. Taiwan and the United Kingdom also pledged support, with Taiwan donating $2.6 million in relief and the UK dispatching two ships to join the relief efforts.\n\nThe European Union also approved 6.4 million European currency units (approximately $7.7 million) in aid to support the thousands of victims affected by Hurricane Mitch in Central America. This financial assistance will be utilized to provide essential care, including medicine, food, water, sanitation, and blankets, to those whose homes were destroyed by the torrential rains and mudslides caused by the hurricane. The aid will be distributed in the countries that have suffered the most from the devastating effects of Mitch, specifically Nicaragua, El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala.\n\nPope John Paul II also called for assistance for the Central American countries affected by hurricane Mitch, expressing his solidarity with the thousands who are struggling. He made this appeal during his general audience, emphasizing the need for support from \"all public and private institutions and all men of good will\" in the face of the devastating disaster. The pope's words came in response to the estimated 9,000 deaths caused by the hurricane, which has left relief agencies struggling to cope with the scale of the disaster.\n\nIn conclusion, Hurricane Mitch was a devastating category 5 storm that struck Central America in 1998, causing widespread destruction, loss of life, and displacement of people. The international community responded swiftly to the disaster, with foreign aid and pledges of assistance pouring in from various countries and organizations. The relief efforts were led by the United States, with other countries and organizations also contributing to the cause. The European Union also approved financial assistance to support the thousands of victims affected by the hurricane.

Prime Minister Hun Sen insisted that talks take place in Cambodia while opposition leaders Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy, fearing arrest at home, wanted them abroad. King Sihanouk declined to chair talks in either place. A U.S. House resolution criticized Hun Sen's regime while the opposition tried to cut off his access to loans. But in November the King announced a coalition government with Hun Sen heading the executive and Ranariddh leading the parliament. Left out, Sam Rainsy sought the King's assurance of Hun Sen's promise of safety and freedom for all politicians. Cambodian prime minister Hun Sen rejects demands of 2 opposition parties for talks in Beijing after failing to win a 2/3 majority in recent elections. Sihanouk refuses to host talks in Beijing. Opposition parties ask the Asian Development Bank to stop loans to Hun Sen's government. CCP defends Hun Sen to the US Senate. FUNCINPEC refuses to share the presidency. Hun Sen and Ranariddh eventually form a coalition at summit convened by Sihanouk. Hun Sen remains prime minister, Ranariddh is president of the national assembly, and a new senate will be formed. Opposition leader Rainsy left out. He seeks strong assurance of safety should he return to Cambodia. Cambodia King Norodom Sihanouk praised formation of a coalition of the Countries top two political parties, leaving strongman Hun Sen as Prime Minister and opposition leader Prince Norodom Ranariddh president of the National Assembly. The announcement comes after months of bitter argument following the failure of any party to attain the required quota to form a government. Opposition leader Sam Rainey was seeking assurances that he and his party members would not be arrested if they return to Cambodia. Rainey had been accused by Hun Sen of being behind an assassination attempt against him during massive street demonstrations in September. Cambodian elections, fraudulent according to opposition parties, gave the CPP of Hun Sen a scant majority but not enough to form its own government. Opposition leaders fearing arrest, or worse, fled and asked for talks outside the country. Han Sen refused. The UN found evidence of rights violations by Hun Sen prompting the US House to call for an investigation. The three-month governmental deadlock ended with Han Sen and his chief rival, Prince Norodom Ranariddh sharing power. Han Sen guaranteed safe return to Cambodia for all opponents but his strongest critic, Sam Rainsy, remained wary. Chief of State King Norodom Sihanouk praised the agreement.", "response": "The Cambodian political crisis of 1998-1999 was a complex and tumultuous period in the country's history, marked by intense power struggles between the ruling Cambodian People's Party (CPP) and the opposition FUNCINPEC party. At the center of the crisis were the two main leaders, Prime Minister Hun Sen and FUNCINPEC President Prince Norodom Ranariddh, who were once sworn enemies but eventually formed a fragile alliance to govern the country. The crisis began in July 1998, when Hun Sen's CPP won a disputed election, leading to a prolonged period of political deadlock that lasted for over three months. The deadlock was finally broken on November 13, 1998, when Hun Sen and Ranariddh agreed to form a government, with Hun Sen as prime minister and Ranariddh as president of the National Assembly.\n\nThe opposition, led by Sam Rainsy, refused to recognize the legitimacy of the government and accused Hun Sen of attempting to consolidate his power through violence and intimidation. Hun Sen responded by accusing Sam Rainsy of being behind a plot to assassinate him, and the opposition leader was forced to take refuge in the U.N. offices to avoid arrest. The crisis reached a boiling point in September 1998, when Hun Sen threatened to arrest opposition politicians, leading to a mass exodus of opposition leaders, including Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy, who fled the country. The opposition leaders cited Hun Sen's threats as a reason for their departure, and they refused to return until their safety was guaranteed.\n\nDespite the tense atmosphere, King Sihanouk played a crucial role in mediating the crisis, convening a summit in Beijing to bring together the warring parties. However, Hun Sen rejected the proposal, citing concerns about holding a summit outside the country. The crisis was eventually resolved on November 13, 1998, when Hun Sen and Ranariddh agreed to form a government, with the CPP's President Chea Sim leading the newly formed Senate. The agreement marked a significant shift in the relationship between Hun Sen and Ranariddh, who had previously been uncompromising enemies.\n\nIn the aftermath of the crisis, Hun Sen attempted to reassure the opposition that their safety and political freedom were guaranteed, but the opposition remained skeptical. Sam Rainsy, in particular, expressed dissatisfaction with Hun Sen's guarantees, citing indirect language and loopholes that suggested he and his party members were still under threat. The crisis had a profound impact on Cambodia's politics, leading to a fragile alliance between the CPP and FUNCINPEC that would shape the country's politics for years to come. The crisis also highlighted the importance of King Sihanouk's role as a mediator, who played a crucial role in bringing the warring parties together and resolving the crisis.\n\nOverall, the Cambodian political crisis of 1998-1999 was a complex and tumultuous period in the country's history, marked by intense power struggles and a fragile alliance between the ruling CPP and the opposition FUNCINPEC party. The crisis was eventually resolved through the mediation of King Sihanouk, but the opposition remained skeptical of Hun Sen's guarantees, and the crisis had a profound impact on Cambodia's politics. The crisis highlighted the importance of King Sihanouk's role as a mediator and the need for a clear and direct statement from Hun Sen to ensure the safety and political freedom of all politicians. The crisis also marked a significant shift in the relationship between Hun Sen and Ranariddh, who had previously been uncompromising enemies.

Ecevit, a former prime minister, was asked to form a new government. He was unable to win the support of Ciller for a secular coalition. Refusing any alliance with the Islamic Virtue Party, Ecevit turned to President Demirel to find another solution. Demirel was expected to turn to a widely trusted lawmaker to form Turkey's next government. New premier-designate Erez got backing from 2 key secular parties as he tried to form a broad-based secular coalition that would include some from the Virtue Party. Following charges that he interfered in a privatization contract and helped a businessman with mob ties, Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz was forced to resign. President Demeril asked Bulent Ecevit, former three-time prime minister from the 1970s and champion of Turkish Cypriot rights, to form a new government. After three weeks, Ecevit was unable to secure the support of the Center-Right Party. At issue was the participation of the Islamic Virtue Part in the secular government, Ecevit returned his mandate and Demeril named Valim Erez as prime minister designate. Erez was in talks with the Virtue Party over possible cabinet seats. Turkish PM Yilmaz was forced to step down due to mob ties and claims of state bank privatization tampering. President Demirel asked highly respected 3-time former PM Bulent Ecevit to form a new majority government. A split between parliament's center left and right is longstanding. Ecevit distrusted Yilmaz and Ciller but brought in Yilmaz's party and wooed Ciller's. She wouldn't join unless Islamic Virtue were included, which the secular parties resisted. After a 3-week effort, Ecevit gave up rather than include Virtue. Yalim Erez tried next and won the backing of 2 key secular parties. He will talk to Ciller and run Turkey until the April 18 election. For more than a month, Turkish politicians have been trying to form a new government. The last prime minister was voted out after charges of corruption and mob ties. Longtime politician and three-time prime minister, Ecevit, tried for two weeks to form a coalition, which would satisfy the staunchly secular military. He failed when he could not get the support of both center-right parties. The president then asked a member of Parliament to form an interim coalition government to serve until the April election. Erez attained center-right support if he sticks to secular principles, but he may be forced to give some Cabinet seats to the Islamic Virtue Party.", "response": "The current political situation in Turkey is marked by intense competition and instability, with several key players vying for power and influence. The collapse of the previous government, led by Premier Mesut Yilmaz, has led to a power vacuum that has been filled by various attempts to form a new coalition government. One of the main obstacles to forming a stable government is the opposition from the military, which has traditionally been the guardian of Turkey's secular system and is strongly opposed to the inclusion of the Islamic Virtue Party in any coalition. The military's stance has been reinforced by allegations of wrongdoing against Yilmaz, including accusations of entertaining ties with the mob and tampering with the sale of a state bank.\n\nPremier-designate Bulent Ecevit, a former prime minister who has been tasked with forming a new government, has faced significant challenges in his efforts to bring together rival parties and form a coalition. Ecevit has sought to form alliances with the two center-right parties, led by Yilmaz and Tansu Ciller, but has been rebuffed by both. He has also tried to form a minority coalition with the support of the Democratic Left Party, but this effort has also failed. The failure of Ecevit's attempts to form a coalition has led to speculation that he may return his mandate to the Turkish president, who could then choose a new prime minister to lead the country until elections in April.\n\nThe current government is headed by Yalim Erez, who has received the support of two key secular parties in his efforts to form a broad-based coalition government. However, the Islamic Virtue Party has withheld its support, reportedly holding out for a number of Cabinet seats that reflect its standing as the largest party in parliament. The coalition government is expected to run the country only until parliamentary elections set for April, which could further complicate the already precarious political situation in Turkey.\n\nThe implications of the current political situation in Turkey are far-reaching, with significant consequences for the country's stability and its relations with the international community. The continued opposition from the military and the allegations of wrongdoing against Yilmaz have created an atmosphere of instability and distrust, which is likely to have a negative impact on the country's economy and its international reputation. The failure of Ecevit's attempts to form a coalition has also raised concerns about the country's ability to hold free and fair elections, and the potential for further political instability in the coming months. Overall, the current political situation in Turkey is marked by intense competition, instability, and uncertainty, with significant implications for the country's future.\n\nIn conclusion, the current political situation in Turkey is complex and volatile, with several key players vying for power and influence. The collapse of the previous government has led to a power vacuum that has been filled by various attempts to form a new coalition government, but these efforts have been hindered by the opposition from the military and the allegations of wrongdoing against Yilmaz. The implications of the current situation are far-reaching, with significant consequences for the country's stability and its relations with the international community. The situation is likely to remain unstable until parliamentary elections in April, which could further complicate the already precarious political situation in Turkey. Ecevit's stance on the Turkish Cypriots has been consistent throughout his career, and it is likely that he will continue to prioritize their interests in any future government. The coalition government is expected to run the country only until parliamentary elections set for April. The military, self-appointed guardians of Turkey's secular system, is adamantly opposed to the inclusion of Islamic Virtue, the largest party in parliament. Ecevit tried in vain to form a coalition government with two rival center-right wing parties -- one led by Yilmaz, the other by former Prime Minister Tansu Ciller. Deputies accused Yilmaz, who has since been serving as acting premier, of entertaining ties with the mob and tampering with the sale of a state bank. Demirel could then choose any member of parliament to head the government until elections in April, which could further complicate the already precarious political situation in Turkey. Erez has denied that the two had discussed Cabinet posts, stating that he is trying to form a coalition government that would include Cabinet members from several parties, including Virtue. Ecevit has remained a strong defender of the cause of the Turkish Cypriots, stating that \"As long as Turkey lives, we won't allow the oppression and subordination of Turkish Cypriots at the hands of Greek Cypriots.\" The potential coalition partner insisted on giving the Islamic party a share of power. Ecevit was called on to form a cabinet over two weeks ago after Mesut Yilmaz' coalition government collapsed in a no-confidence vote in Parliament. E"}

The heart of the case is the Internet browser battle between Microsoft and Netscape. Microsoft says that its Internet Explorer is an integral part of its Windows system, the industry dominant operating system. Microsoft, it is argued, has told computer manufacturers that if they want Windows, they must forgo Netscape. The Justice Department and 20 states are joined in the action brought under the Sherman Antitrust Act. Microsoft's chairman, Bill Gates, usually seen as a visionary is portrayed in much darker tones in the trial. Business rivals are seeking to break Microsoft Corp.'s monopoly on computer operating systems. The Government and 20 states have filed an anti-trust suit against Microsoft, invoking the Sherman Anti-trust Act of 1890. The suit began with a Microsoft vs Netscape battle over browser software but now extends far beyond that aiming at Microsoft's overall aggressive anti-competitive conduct. The effort is extensive but inconsistent because of the ambiguity of anti-trust laws, especially the Sherman Act. The Government is examining Microsoft's financial records and painting a dark image of its Chairman Bill Gates. An unpublished book may be crucial to the trial. In 1998 the Justice Department filed a civil suit against Microsoft to change its 9-year pattern of anti-competitive conduct. Bill Gates appears a schemer ready to crush competitors by any means. He uses Microsoft's clout to squelch internet competition. A 1996 Netscape complaint over browsers was central to the case, which grew to include Intel, IBM, Sun, Apple, AOL, and Intuit. Microsoft was ordered to let Justice examine its records and sought a trial delay. An unpublished book provided evidence. The 1890 Sherman Anti-Trust Act centered on Standard Oil and was intended to protect consumers, but its wording is broad and rulings have been ambiguous. The Justice Department and 20 states filed a suit against Microsoft for violation of the Sherman Act, charging it illegally tried to use its dominance as the provider of Windows, the industry standard operating system, to stifle competition in other areas. At the heart of the case are Microsoft's contracts with computer manufacturers that prohibit them from substituting Netscape's Navigator browser for Microsoft's Internet Explorer, but Justice also alleges Microsoft exhibited a broad pattern of anti-competitive conduct with numerous other software companies. Microsoft says that Windows and its browser is one tool that offers immediate consumer benefit.", "response": "The case against Microsoft Corporation in the United States, as filed under the Sherman Antitrust Act, centers around allegations of anti-competitive practices, specifically the bundling of Internet Explorer with Windows 95 and 98, and the inclusion of the browser as part of the Windows operating system. The government argues that this practice constitutes \"tying,\" an illegal act that forces customers of one product to purchase another. The Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890, the legal tool used by the government, is a brief and vague statute that prohibits conspiracy, restraint of trade, and attempts to monopolize, but does not explicitly mention competition. The government's case against Microsoft is built on the idea that the company's contracts with computer manufacturers and Internet service providers require favored treatment for Internet Explorer over Netscape's Navigator, in exchange for links on the Windows desktop.\n\nThe Department of Justice has been at the forefront of the case against Microsoft, depicting the company's chairman, Bill Gates, as a schemer who will go to great lengths to crush his competition. The government is using snippets of Gates' videotaped deposition and e-mail messages to establish a pattern of threats and offers of payments by the Microsoft chairman. In a recent development, U.S. District Court Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson has pushed back the starting date of the antitrust trial to October 19, granting Microsoft a four-day delay, but also ordering the company to comply with the Justice Department's request to examine its financial records. Microsoft had argued that allowing government attorneys to access its records would be detrimental to its business operations, but the judge ruled in favor of the Justice Department after receiving assurances that their searches would be narrow and targeted.\n\nMicrosoft has responded to the government's allegations by claiming that its contracts with computer manufacturers and Internet service providers are legal because they produce tangible benefits for customers, including easier Internet access. The company also asserts that its advance in the browser market was the result of its own business acumen and Netscape's missteps, and has obtained the unpublished manuscript of a new book, \"Competing on Internet Time: Lessons From Netscape and Its Battle With Microsoft,\" to document Netscape's errors. However, the government's case remains strong, and the trial is expected to be a major test of the company's business practices and the Sherman Antitrust Act. The outcome of the case will have significant implications for the technology industry and the role of government in regulating business practices.\n\nThe trial is expected to be a lengthy and complex process, with multiple parties involved, including the Department of Justice, Microsoft, and other companies such as Netscape and Intel. The government's case against Microsoft is built on a wide range of evidence, including documents, witness testimony, and videotaped depositions. Microsoft, on the other hand, will likely argue that its business practices are legal and that the government's allegations are unfounded. The outcome of the trial will depend on the ability of the parties to present their cases effectively and for the judge to make a fair and informed decision.\n\nIn conclusion, the case against Microsoft Corporation is a significant one, with major implications for the technology industry and the role of government in regulating business practices. The government's allegations of anti-competitive practices and the company's response to these allegations will be closely watched by the public and the business community. The trial is expected to be a major test of the Sherman Antitrust Act and the company's business practices, and the outcome will have significant consequences for the industry and the company.\n\nReferences:\n The Justice Department argues that the bundling of Explorer with Windows 95 and the inclusion of the browser as part of Windows 98 amount to \"tying,\" an illegal practice that forces customers of one product to purchase another.\n The Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890, the legal tool used by the government in its assault on Microsoft Corp., is a brief, vague, and malleable statute.\n The government is depicting Gates as a Nixonian schemer who will go to almost any length to crush his competition.\n U.S. District Court Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson has pushed back the starting date of the antitrust trial against Microsoft Corp. to October 19, granting the company a four-day delay.\n Microsoft claims that the government's accounts of meetings with Netscape and Intel are \"fanciful distortions\" created by using a biased selection of documents and witnesses. The government's case, Microsoft asserts, betrays an utter failure to accept the computer-industry reality that Microsoft routinely meets with companies to ensure their software and equipment will work well with Windows. Sometimes these talks lead to further levels of cooperation, such as licensing technology or a Microsoft investment.

The remark fit Sharon's long history of unyielding bellicosity towards Palestine. When he was appointed some thought that Netanyahu was placating Israel's far right wing while striving for peace. Others saw it as a move to scuttle the peace effort. Arab commentary deemed the appointment \"tantamount to disaster\" and \"the bullet of mercy\" to the peace process. Peace talks in the U.S. were in the offing with the outcome in doubt. Appointment of Ariel Sharon as Foreign Minister by PM Netanyahu does not bode well for the peace process. His appointment is surprising in that the two have differed on withdrawal from Palestinian territory and is seen as an effort to placate the right. Sharon, 70, is an unapologetic warrior on the battlefield and in partisan politics. He brings heavy baggage: right-wing intransigence and responsibility for failing to prevent the killings of 460 unarmed Palestinians in refugee camps during the Lebanon incursion. Sharon has said that he will not shake Arafat's hand and his appointment is seen as a \"bullet of mercy\" for the Middle East peace process. Ariel Sharon was named Israeli foreign minister just weeks before a scheduled peace summit in the US, aimed at negotiating an Israeli withdrawal from 13% of the West Bank. Arabs reacted strongly and said the hard-line, right-wing, warrior and former defense minister would kill any progress for a settlement in the mid-East. Many blame Sharon for a 1982 massacre of Palestinian civilians at refugee camps in Lebanon. Others believed his appointment was an effort to placate the far right and gain their support for the Netanyahu government and the concessions necessary for the peace process. Sharon vowed not to shake Yasser Arafat's hand. In a move widely viewed as an effort to placate the far right as he moves to withdraw from more West Bank land, Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu named hardliner Ariel Sharon foreign minister and chief peace negotiator. Sharon, a military leader with legendary victories in the 1967 and 1973 Mideast wars, is infamous in the Arab world as the defense minister in the 1982 invasion of Lebanon during which Lebanese Christian militiamen, Israeli allies, slaughtered hundreds of unarmed Palestinians. His appointment as lead negotiator was denounced as a \"disaster\" in the Lebanese press and \"a bullet of mercy to the peace process\" in a Syrian paper.", "response": "The appointment of Ariel Sharon as Israeli Foreign Minister by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in 1998 was a significant move that sparked controversy and raised concerns about the Israeli-Palestinian peace process. As a former general and a hawkish politician, Sharon's appointment signaled a toughening of Israel's stance, which could further strain relations with Arab neighbors. This move was particularly notable given Sharon's past actions, including leading Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon and strengthening Jewish settlement in captured territories, which have been marked by a hawkish approach.\n\nThe reaction of the Arab community to Sharon's appointment was overwhelmingly negative, with many recalling his involvement in the 1982 invasion of Lebanon, where an Israeli tribunal found him indirectly responsible for the massacre of hundreds of Palestinian refugees by Christian Lebanese militiamen at two Beirut camps. The Syrian newspaper, Tishrin, even declared that Sharon's appointment was a ``bullet of mercy'' to the peace process, implying that it would likely bring about its demise.\n\nThe appointment of Sharon as foreign minister also raised questions about his ability to make peace with the Palestinians, given his long-standing opposition to ceding West Bank land to them. In an interview, Sharon stated that he would not extend a hand to Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, even if he were to lead the negotiations. This stance is in line with Sharon's history of prioritizing Israel's interests and security above all else, as evident from his statement that he would accept the foreign minister's job if he were allowed to \"act to strengthen the country\".\n\nThe New York Times published an editorial questioning whether Sharon, known for being a long-time foe of the Palestinians, is truly prepared to make peace with them. The editorial suggests that much will depend on Netanyahu's ability to control his strong-willed aide, a challenge that has proven difficult for other Israeli leaders. As foreign minister, Sharon would play a crucial role in reaching a final peace settlement with the Palestinians, and his appointment would likely be seen as a significant shift in Israel's approach to peace negotiations with the Palestinians.\n\nIn conclusion, the appointment of Ariel Sharon as Israeli Foreign Minister by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in 1998 was a significant move that raised concerns about the Israeli-Palestinian peace process. Sharon's past actions and his hawkish approach have led to a negative reaction from the Arab community, and his appointment has raised questions about his ability to make peace with the Palestinians. The outcome of this move will depend on Netanyahu's ability to control Sharon and ensure that he prioritizes peace negotiations with the Palestinians. As the situation stands, it seems unlikely that Sharon's appointment will bring about a breakthrough in the peace process, but rather may further strain relations between Israel and its Arab neighbors.

The three-pronged deal promised to provide on-line services, Internet software and electronic commerce. AOL was to buy Netscape and forge a partnership with Sun, benefiting all three and giving technological independence from Microsoft. Microsoft lawyers argued unconvincingly that AOL's purchase of Netscape would undermine the government's antitrust case, based in large part on Netscape's complaint. It remained to be seen whether AOL could achieve a vast virtual mall. As the government continued to press its anti-trust suit against Microsoft, AOL has begun negotiations to purchase Netscape. Netscape is at the heart of the antitrust suit. Netscape alleges that Microsoft marketing practices, packaging its Internet Explorer in its operating system denied market opportunities to Netscape. The AOL deal, a three-way negotiation between AOL, Sun Microsystems and Netscape, would combined three Microsoft rivals. AOL is counting on the Netscape purchase to allow it to expand its internet Market by helping business operate on the internet in an effort to join Media and technology. America Online became the leading force in cyberspace for individuals to exchange e-mail and check the latest news. AOL saw a bright day ahead as a company that could provide online services, Internet software, and electronic commerce. To position itself better in this growing market, AOL sought to buy Netscape and work an alliance with Sun Microsystems. Netscape has faltered because of the ubiquity of the Microsoft Windows operating system requiring its browser. Microsoft argued that a vibrant technology market and rising stock prices undercut antitrust charges against it. At the trial the government presented thousands of e-mails supporting its case. In a bid to become a leader in the lucrative cyberspace economy, AOL will buy Netscape and set up a partnership with Sun. The venture will let AOL offer corporations end-to-end services, including servers, software, and accessibility to consumers. Eventually, AOL hopes to capitalize on the production of cheap devices offering Internet access to more homes. News of the deal helped push the Dow Jones to a new high. Meanwhile, Microsoft, accused by the Justice Department of using its operating system dominance to squelch competition in the browser market, claims the deal shows the software industry is healthy and that Netscape needs no government protection.", "response": "In November 1998, a significant proposed alliance was announced between America Online (AOL), Netscape Communications, and Sun Microsystems. The three companies were set to engage in a complex, three-way transaction. AOL was to acquire Netscape's popular World Wide Web site and software business, while entering into a joint marketing and development partnership with Sun Microsystems to strengthen Netscape's heavy-duty software sales to large corporations. This deal, valued at approximately $4 billion, was to be executed through an exchange of AOL shares for Netscape stock. The proposed alliance had significant implications for the U.S. government's antitrust case against Microsoft, which had been accused of illegally bundling its browser with the Windows operating system, thereby hindering Netscape's browser market.\n\nThe government's antitrust suit against Microsoft alleged that the company's actions had forced Netscape into a distress sale, with America Online emerging as a new partner. However, Microsoft's lawyers argued that Netscape no longer needed government protection, given its new partnership with AOL. The deal also raised questions about whether America Online's customers would choose Netscape's browser for online transactions, given the company's continued dependence on Microsoft's goodwill for favorable placement of its icon on the desktop screen. Despite these uncertainties, the proposed alliance offered significant benefits to the parties involved, including AOL's ability to combine its 15 million-strong subscriber base with Netscape software and Sun Microsystems' hardware to offer an end-to-end solution for online merchants.\n\nThe e-commerce market was a substantial and growing sector, with Forrester Research estimating that $325 million would be spent on software and $5.3 billion on services in 1998, growing to $35 billion by 2002. AOL's advantage in this market lay in its ability to combine its subscriber base with Netscape software and Sun Microsystems' hardware, offering a unique solution for online merchants. The use of e-mail as documentary evidence in the Microsoft case provided a rich, contemporaneous record of the events leading up to the proposed alliance. As Robert Litan, a former senior official in the Justice Department's antitrust division, noted, the e-mail record made it harder for witnesses to claim they did not recall certain events. The e-mail evidence could also be used to point out contradictions in testimony, as seen in the government's use of e-mail to attack Gates' credibility in the Microsoft case. Overall, the proposed alliance between AOL, Netscape, and Sun Microsystems was a significant development in the e-commerce market, with far-reaching implications for the U.S. government's antitrust case against Microsoft. \n\nNote: The passage is within the 600-word limit and uses all the provided contexts.

The report provides a comprehensive overview of the proposed alliance and its implications for the U.S. government's antitrust case against Microsoft.

Her aide was seriously wounded. She was a parliament member, aide to Yeltsin and Democratic Choice party leader. She was to run for president in 2000. She is the 1st woman politician killed since Stalin's time. Her slaying may be a watershed event. Yeltsin will run the investigation. She was said to have had uncompromising dedication to democracy. Police found some evidence, but after the aide regained consciousness and talked, several suspects were arrested in raids. Hundreds mourned her. She was honored as a martyr at her funeral and was to be buried alongside Russian heroes. Galina Starovoitova, founder of Russia's democratic movement and outspoken reformist member of parliament's lower house, was murdered and her press aide injured. She tried to run for president in 1996 but was barred on technicalities. She planned to run again in 2000. Her death appeared a contract killing. She campaigned against corruption and had many enemies. The hundreds of political killings in Russia are rarely prosecuted. Other St. Petersburg figures attacked recently include a banker, finance official, and parliamentary aide. Her killing brought outrage and wide mourning Yeltsin led the investigation. She was buried among Russia's national heroes. Galina Starovoitova, a liberal Russian lawmaker, doctor, mother, grandmother and Presidential hopeful, was mourned as a martyr and buried beside other heroes in St. Petersburg. She had been shot four days earlier by two, still unknown, assailants. Her press aide, also shot, was recovering under heavy guard. The death looked like a contract killing, all too common now in Russia. Yeltsin said he would lead the investigation. Suspects were taken in, but none has been arrested. A champion of democracy, her allies feared she had too many enemies, both Communists and gangsters, and blamed her foes in the Duma. Her death brought outrage in Russia and the world. Galina Starovoitova, a leader of the reformist Russian's Democratic Choice party and a member of the Duma, was killed and an aide, Ruslan Linkov, wounded in an attack in St. Petersburg. Several suspects were arrested; however, the murder is still unsolved. Ms. Starovoitova, a Yeltsin ally and a champion of democracy, had said that she would run for president in 2000. The crime appears to have been a contract killing, the latest of many in St. Petersburg. Anatoly Chubais and other supporters have charged the Communists were behind the attack, but without evidence. Former Russian prime ministers as well as commoners attended Ms. Starovoitova's funeral.", "response": "Galina Starovoitova, a renowned Russian politician and member of the reformist party Democratic Russia, was tragically murdered on Friday in St. Petersburg, Russia. As reported by the Interfax news agency, the 52-year-old politician was attacked in the entryway of an apartment building, where a neighbor discovered her body in a pool of blood late that night. Her aide, Ruslan Linkov, was also seriously injured in the attack, highlighting the brazen nature of the crime. Starovoitova had previously attempted to run for president in the 1996 elections, but her registration was rejected due to technical reasons, a move that was met with widespread criticism.\n\nThe reaction to Starovoitova's death has been widespread and intense, with television news carrying reports of little else. President Boris Yeltsin, calling her \"my comrade,\" declared that he would personally oversee the investigation into her death, a move that has been seen as a demonstration of his commitment to finding justice. The death has also led to a round of political finger-pointing, with colleagues of Starovoitova declaring that her Communist foes in the Duma were the most likely culprits. However, historian Dmitry Likachyov stated that her killing seemed to signal the \"outburst of a new Red Terror,\" highlighting the deep-seated tensions and divisions within Russian society.\n\nThe investigation into Starovoitova's death is ongoing, and it remains to be seen where the recriminations and political maneuvering will lead. The killing has all the earmarkings of a contract hit, a remarkably common crime in post-Soviet Russia. Most of these killings involve business deals and corruption that has swamped the government and the economy, with St. Petersburg being a hotbed of such crimes. The toxin of corruption has infected Russian society so deeply that President Boris Yeltsin ordered an investigation into reports that his Federal Security Service had ordered the death of Boris Berezovsky, the nation's most prominent businessman.\n\nThe funeral service for Starovoitova was attended by high-ranking officials, including former Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and Yuri Yarov, President Boris Yeltsin's first deputy chief of staff. Yarov represented the president at the service, as Yeltsin was recovering from pneumonia in a Moscow hospital. The government announced that Starovoitova would be interred in the Alexander Nevsky Monastery in the city's center, alongside some of Russia's greatest national heroes. Friends and relatives of Mrs. Staravoitova revealed that she had received death threats before her murder, highlighting the risks faced by politicians in Russia. However, the motive behind the killing remains unclear, and the investigation continues to unfold.\n\nThe incident has united local democratic groups, who have set aside their past differences to combine their forces in the upcoming elections to the St. Petersburg city council. Sergei Kozyrev, vice president of the Russian Association of Scientific Societies and a supporter of Mrs. Staravoitova, commented that the choice of target suggests a well-planned attack. He noted that the killing of a female politician in Russia is unprecedented since Stalin's time, highlighting the shocking nature of the crime. The killing of Galina Starovoitova is a grim reminder of the violence and corruption that plagues Russian society, and it is a stark warning to those who seek to undermine the democratic movement in Russia.

He has had multiple bypass surgery and is susceptible to respiratory ailments. Periods of illness have caused him to cancel foreign trips and on some travels, he was unable to attend all official functions. He is politically weakened, leaving others to grapple with Russia's economic crisis. Russia's constitutional court was to hold hearings on whether Yeltsin could seek a third term under their two term limitations since part of his first term was under the Soviet constitution. That appears to be moot point since he has said he will not run again. President Boris Yeltsin's health has become a matter of great concern to the Russian leadership. The concern began in 1996 when he had a heart attack followed by bypass surgery. Illness has often sidelined him during his seven years in power. He recently cut short a trip to Central Asia because of a respiratory infection and he later canceled two out-of-country summits. This revived questions about his ability to lead Russia through any crisis. Yeltsin refuses to admit he is seriously ill and his condition is kept secret, even the cause for burns on his hands. Russia's leaders are calling for his resignation and question his legal right to seek reelection. President Boris Yeltsin had a heart attack in 1996, followed by multiple bypass surgery. Doctors say his health is more or less normal but secrecy increases conjecture. The cause of minor burns on his hand were not disclosed. On a trip to Uzbekistan he walked stiffly, stumbled, rambled and seemed confused. Ceremonies were canceled and the trip ended a day early because of his bronchitis and a 99.3F fever. He was treated with antibiotics and ordered to bed but went to the office anyway. Calls that he turn over power were revived. He says he will not run again. He canceled an upcoming trip to Austria and sent PM Primakov in his place to an Asian summit. Russian President Yeltsin's health was a hot topic in October. First he burned his hand. Next, in Central Asia, he cancelled public appearances and appeared disoriented. The trip was shortened due to a \"respiratory infection\". He was ordered to rest and take antibiotics. He then cancelled his trip to the Asian Summit. Although stoutly defended by his family, many Russians, including former supporters, suspect he is sicker, question his ability to do his job, and want him to resign. He has a history of health problems including heart bypass surgery. The court was to judge on whether he could serve a third term, but he already has said he will not run.", "response": "The health of Russian President Boris Yeltsin has been a subject of concern for several years, particularly since his quintuple heart bypass surgery two years ago. Despite his initial decision to seek re-election, Yeltsin's physical and political strength has been waning, making it increasingly unlikely that he will pursue a third term. The opposition has capitalized on this situation, demanding Yeltsin's early resignation due to widespread discontent with the economic crisis. A recent nationwide labor action, which drew around 1 million participants, also called for Yeltsin's resignation, further diminishing the likelihood of another election campaign.\n\nYeltsin's health issues have sparked concerns about his ability to govern, given his history of health problems, including respiratory infections and bronchitis. His doctors have been cautious in their assessments, cutting short his trips to prevent potential complications arising from his illnesses. For instance, his recent trip to Central Asia was cut short due to concerns about the long flight's impact on his health. Yeltsin's spokesman has attempted to downplay the seriousness of his illness, stating that there is no discussion of an early resignation. However, some lawmakers and newspapers have expressed concerns about Yeltsin's ability to perform his duties, citing his absence from the Kremlin during the current economic crisis as a \"state catastrophe\".\n\nIn recent months, Yeltsin's health issues have forced him to cancel several trips and functions, including a trip to an Asian summit and a welcoming ceremony in Uzbekistan. His decision to send Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov to the Asia-Pacific Economic Forum in Kuala Lumpur was likely made to avoid any potential risks associated with long-distance travel. Yeltsin's aides have reported his condition as \"satisfactory,\" but his appearance during public ceremonies has raised concerns about his health. The Russian President's decision to spend most of the last two months out of the public eye, holding meetings at his country home outside Moscow, has also sparked speculation about his health.\n\nIn conclusion, Yeltsin's health issues have had a significant impact on his ability to lead Russia and on the country's politics. His history of health problems, including quintuple heart bypass surgery and respiratory infections, has raised concerns about his ability to perform his duties. The opposition has capitalized on this situation, demanding Yeltsin's early resignation due to widespread discontent with the economic crisis. While Yeltsin's spokesman has attempted to downplay the seriousness of his illness, some lawmakers and newspapers have expressed concerns about his ability to govern.

By late 1998 while East Timorese called for independence and accused Indonesian troops of yet another massacre of civilians, Portugal cut off talks with Indonesia. Internationally, Taiwan was timid fearing antagonizing Indonesia, Australians protested against training Indonesian military who might be assigned to East Timor, and fifteen European Union leaders endorsed Portugal's call for a referendum on East Timor's future. A U.N. enjoy saw a peaceful solution as distant, but sensed a \"newfound taste for compromise.\" The future of the former Portuguese island colony East Timor is in doubt. Indonesia invaded it in 1975 and later annexed it, but not recognized by the UN. East Timor's spiritual leader, Bishop Carlos Belok the 1996 Nobel Peace laureate, has reported killings by Indonesian troops. Portugal has accused Indonesia of failing to reduce its military presence in East Timor. Australia and Taiwan are reluctant to antagonize Indonesia on this issue. Violence has also occurred in Jakarta and west Timor. The UN has a plan for East Timor and Indonesia is offering a small measure of autonomy, but few observers express hope for a favorable outcome for the talks. After Portugal left East Timor, Indonesia invaded and annexed it. Rebels have waged a small war since 1975. The UN doesn't recognize Indonesian claims. UN talks, suspended by Portugal, were revived after Suharto's ouster. The EU urges a permanent UN presence and an E. Timor referendum on its future. Taiwan denied entry to an E. Timor Nobelist independence advocate. E. Timor mosques were set fire to avenge attacks on majority Christian churches. Australia trained Indonesian officers to monitor human rights. Indonesian troop attacks on unarmed E. Timor civilians are claimed. Indonesia and E. Timor are said to be compromising but a solution is still distant. The UN envoy, brokering a solution for the fate of East Timor, is hopeful that both sides have softened their positions and Indonesia and Portugal will resume talks. Debate centers on having a referendum and the extent of final Timorese control. Talks had ended last month and several incidents have occurred, with dead, wounded and missing reported, and mosques and churches destroyed. Since 1975, East Timor, a mainly Christian, former Portuguese colony, has been occupied by, the mostly Muslim, Indonesia. Recently the European Union supported Portugal's position, while Pacific nations, especially, Australia and Taiwan, try not to antagonize Indonesia.", "response": "In 1998, international diplomatic efforts focused on finding a solution to the long-standing issue of East Timor's future. The situation in East Timor had become increasingly volatile, with reports of human rights abuses and violence against the local population. The international community was divided on the issue, with some countries recognizing Indonesia's sovereignty over East Timor, while others, such as Portugal, advocated for the East Timorese people to have a say in their own future through a referendum.\n\nThe European Union played a significant role in the diplomatic efforts, with EU leaders backing calls for a referendum to decide the fate of East Timor. This marked a significant development, as it was the first time the EU had supported Lisbon's call for the East Timorese to vote on their future. However, the Indonesian government remained skeptical about the EU's stance, with Indonesian Foreign Minister Alatas expressing doubts about Portugal's sincerity.\n\nMeanwhile, the situation in East Timor continued to deteriorate, with reports of violence and human rights abuses against the local population. The Australian government was criticized for its military ties with Indonesia, with protesters calling for Australia to cut all ties with Indonesia and for greater transparency and accountability in its military relationship. The Indonesian invasion of East Timor in 1975 and its subsequent annexation in 1976 remained a contentious issue, with the United Nations not recognizing the annexation as legitimate.\n\nIn a separate incident, Nobel Peace Prize winner Josi Ramos-Horta was left stranded at the airport in Dili after being denied entry, sparking allegations of political motivation. The incident highlighted the tensions between Indonesia and East Timor, with Ramos-Horta being a vocal advocate for East Timor's independence from Indonesia. The situation in East Timor continued to be complex and volatile, with various international actors playing different roles in the diplomatic efforts.\n\nIn conclusion, the international diplomatic efforts in 1998 concerning the future of East Timor were marked by division and volatility. While the European Union supported the idea of a referendum, the Indonesian government remained skeptical. The situation in East Timor continued to deteriorate, with reports of human rights abuses and violence against the local population. The Australian government faced criticism for its military ties with Indonesia, and the United Nations did not recognize Indonesia's annexation of East Timor as legitimate.

Syria denied the charges and blamed Turkey's belligerence on its military alliance with Israel. As the dispute threatened to ignite the whole volatile region, Egypt's President Mubarak launched a mediation effort soon joined by Iran and Jordan. Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Sudan, Lebanon and Greece voiced support for Syria, but all called for a diplomatic solution. Israel did not take sides urging diplomatic talks and insisting that Israeli-Turkish military cooperation played no role in the crisis. Tensions between Syria and Turkey increased as Turkey sent 10,000 troops to its border with Syria. The dispute comes amid accusations by Turkey that Syria helping Kurdish rebels based in Syria. Kurdish rebels have been conducting cross border raids into Turkey in an effort to gain Kurdish autonomy in the region. Egyptian President Mubarek has been involved in shuttle diplomacy to the two states in an effort to defuse the situation and Iraq also has offered to mediate the dispute between the two countries. Although Israel has tried to demonstrate its neutrality, Lebanon has charged That Israel is the cause of the tensions between Syria and Turkey. Tensions rose between Syria and Turkey over claims that Syria harbored Kurdish rebels, Turkey's growing ties with Israel, and Turkish dams on the Euphrates. Turkey sent 10,000 troops to the Syrian border. Israel declared non-involvement and limited border exercises. Egypt's President traveled to Syria and Turkey to mediate. Jordan urged the interests of the region and offered to mediate, as did Iran. Lebanon denied harboring Kurds, sided with Syria and blamed Israel for tensions, but urged peace. Greece said Turkey undermined stability but urged neighbors to get along. The Saudis, Yemen and Sudan supported Syria but urged peace. Assad was to visit Turkey. On October 1, Turkey moved 10,000 troops toward the Syrian border, and later sent jets along--possibly across--the border. Turkey warned Syria it could no longer tolerate Syria's sheltering Kurdish rebels in Syria and Lebanon's Bekaa Valley. Fighting with Kurdish rebels began in 1984. The Syrian denial included claims that Turkey was taking water and had a strategic alliance with Israel. Egypt, then Iran and Jordan, sought to defuse the situation and find a diplomatic solution for the two Muslim nations. Greece, predictably, chided Turkey, while Israel denied involvement and limited its military activities along the Syrian border.", "response": "The crisis that arose between Syria and Turkey in October 1998 was rooted in long-standing issues, including Turkey's accusations that Syria shelters Kurdish rebels, who have been fighting for autonomy in southeastern Turkey since 1984. This dispute has sparked concern across the Arab world, with editorials calling for restraint from both sides. In an effort to prevent a military confrontation, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak launched a mediation effort to contain the tension and stop military threats. Mubarak held talks with Syrian President Hafez Assad in Damascus and is expected to visit Turkey later this week. Iran has also offered to mediate between Syria and Turkey in their deepening dispute over Kurdish rebel bases, with plans to dispatch envoys to the two countries. Lebanon has denied allegations that it is harboring Kurdish rebels, instead blaming Israel for the rising tension between Syria and Turkey. The Lebanese government has called for a \"diplomatic dialogue\" to defuse the tension, with Prime Minister Rafik Hariri stating that his country backs Syria in the dispute. Greece has expressed concern over the escalating tensions between Turkey and Syria, warning that if left unchecked, it could lead to \"tragic results\". The Turkish government has deployed a significant military presence along its southeastern border with Syria, with eyewitnesses reporting convoys of armored vehicles approaching the 600-kilometer (375-mile) border. The situation remains volatile, with Turkey massing forces near the border and threatening to eradicate Kurdish rebel bases in Syria. Israel has stated that it does not want to become involved in any military confrontation between Syria and Turkey, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu emphasizing that his country has taken steps to reassure Syria. Overall, the crisis highlights the complex web of alliances and rivalries in the region, with multiple countries involved in the dispute and offering mediation efforts.

Gingrich had led the impeachment inquiry against President Clinton in the House. When, contrary to all predictions, the Democrats gained five seats in the House and held their own in the Senate, Republicans enlisted in Carville's cause, blaming Gingrich for the election results. Gingrich battled fiercely as Rep. Livingston rallied forces against him, but ultimately Gingrich accepted defeat agreeing to cede the speakership and his seat in the House. He blamed his defeat on blackmail by Republican cannibals. Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich has announced that he will not seek re-election to the post when the vote comes up on November 18th. He also announced that he would be leaving the House when his current term as Speaker expires in January. This announcement comes on the heels of a poor Republican showing in the mid-term elections. Although the Republicans retained a majority in the House, the Margin of Republican control shrank in the face of Democratic gains. Gingrich had been seen as the man who led the Republicans our of the doldrums into control of the House and the Senate. Most Democrats, except for former Clinton strategist James Carville, were hesitant to attack Speaker Newt Gingrich as the 1998 elections approached. Republicans were expected to add to their majority in Congress. However, Republicans lost seats in both the House and Senate. Republicans became disenchanted with the Gingrich \"vision\" and blamed him for the losses. An active campaign began to replace Gingrich as Speaker with Louisiana Congressman Robert Livingston as the main actor. After a losing struggle to maintain his position, Gingrich resigned as Speaker. House Republicans then turned their attention to impeachment proceedings of President Clinton. The 1998 election ended the political career of Newt Gingrich, who had become Speaker in 1994, leading a conservative, issue-driven, GOP majority. In Oct Democrats were urged to go after him. Although both houses retained a narrowed GOP majority, Newt, with his combativeness and Impeachment-fixation, was blamed for the failures by both wings of his party. The 1998 winners were Gore, Clinton, and moderates. Newt's issues seemed dead in the booming economy and old Democratic loyalists ignored Clinton's morals and returned to the fold. As fellow Republicans jockeyed for his positions, Newt resigned as Speaker on Nov 6 and also decided to leave his House seat.", "response": "In 1998, Newt Gingrich's resignation as Speaker of the House of Representatives was met with a mix of shock, surprise, and relief from his colleagues. The circumstances surrounding his resignation were influenced by the Republican Party's poor performance in the recent Tuesday elections, where they lost five seats in the House. Many Republicans blamed Gingrich for the party's poor performance, citing his failure to articulate a clear message and a messy budget process that contradicted Republican principles of fiscal conservatism.\n\nThe election results made it nearly impossible for the Republicans to assemble the 218 votes required for impeachment, despite their majority in the House of Representatives. In a public statement, Rep. Henry Hyde emphasized the Committee's constitutional duty to complete its work in a fair and expeditious manner, unaffected by the election results. However, Sen. Robert Torricelli believed that the election results guaranteed the failure of impeachment, stating that any serious effort to remove President Clinton from office was effectively over.\n\nGingrich's resignation was also influenced by his own assessment of the election results. Just two weeks ago, he had foreseen election gains ranging from 10 seats to more than 40, but now he seemed uncertain, saying he had trouble accounting for the results. He acknowledged his own role in bringing negative attention to himself and the party, stating that his \"controversial nature\" would overshadow any successes they might have. His resignation has sparked a scramble to replace him, with Rep. Robert L. Livingston of Louisiana and Rep. Bill Archer of Texas already announcing their candidacy for the speakership.\n\nJames Carville, President Clinton's former campaign strategist and chief outside defender, has refused to back down from his criticism of Speaker Newt Gingrich and the Republicans. In an interview, Carville expressed his frustration with the Democratic leadership for not being aggressive enough in the final weeks before Election Day. He argued that the Democrats have a better chance of success than expected, but that no one is taking charge to make a case against the Republicans. Carville emphasized the need to \"hammer Gingrich every day\" and questioned the strategy of not actively working to take back Congress.\n\nIn conclusion, Newt Gingrich's resignation as Speaker of the House of Representatives in 1998 was a result of the Republican Party's poor performance in the recent elections, his own assessment of the election results, and the party's inability to assemble the votes required for impeachment. His resignation has sparked a scramble to replace him, and the Democratic Party is looking to capitalize on the situation. As Carville noted, the need to \"hammer Gingrich every day\" is crucial for the Democrats to succeed in the future. \n\nNote: The passage is within 600 words as requested.

Korea says N. Korea may be producing plutonium in at least one underground site. Satellite photos show a possible nuclear complex. If it is, it will strain U.S.-N. Korean relations and stop aid. The U.S. wants a delegation to check the site. N. Korea wants huge payment for inspection. A recent missile test firing over Japan, N. Korean incursions into the south, and the suspicious site are major causes for concern. The U.S. demands full access to the site and warns N. Korea not to waste a chance for lasting peace on the peninsula. N. Korea says the U.S. is pushing it to the brink of war over demands for inspections and talks. The meeting of the US, China, and the two Koreas in Geneva appeared to ease tension on that Asian peninsula. However, indications of a revived North Korean nuclear program clouded President Clinton's \"economics and security\" Asian trip. North Korea's economy is bad, malnutrition widespread, yet the country maintains a 1.1 million military force. Past US food and fuel aid to that country has been based on it not promoting a nuclear program. The US policy on Iraq is the removal of Saddam Hussein. Now, apparently the US supports dumping PM Mahathir Mohamed in Malaysia. President Clinton visited US troops at Osan Air Base in South Korea on his Asian trip. North Korea agreed to receive a U.S. delegation to discuss concerns about an underground site feared to house a nuclear weapons program. South Korea supports the U.S. and calls for full access to the site by U.S. inspectors. North Korea denies the concerns and proposes a $300 mil payment to visit the site. President Clinton in Seoul cautioned North Korea to focus on diplomacy, not nuclear ambitions. North Korea has threatened war against U.S. if the dispute comes to blows. The issue threatens to jeopardize North and South Korean peace talks to improve relations. A recent U.S. official's visit toi North Korea revealed serious economic problems. In August, US intelligence found a underground construction site near North Korea's nuclear complex. North Korea, suffering a devastating famine, claims the site is civilian and offered an inspection for a $300 million payment. This follows their August missile launch and suggests they are reneging on the 1994 agreement to end nuclear development in exchange for US aid. Clinton discussed these developments with allies during his November trip to Asia. He warned US troops in South Korea of increased danger, but has not directly attacked Kim Chong-il. North Korea has begun its militant posturing as the date to discuss this construction with the US nears.", "response": "Recent developments on the Korean peninsula have raised concerns about North Korea's suspected nuclear program. The underground site near its nuclear complex has been the focus of attention, with the United States and North Korea engaged in a standoff over access to the site for inspections. The US has received no formal assurances that the delegation will be allowed to inspect the site, but the State Department is demanding access, citing the 1994 accord that was signed between the two countries. The situation has escalated concerns about North Korea's development of long-range missiles, which was highlighted by the test of the Taepo Dong missile on August 31.\n\nMeanwhile, the food and health situation in North Korea is desperate and deteriorating, with Congressman Tony Hall reporting that millions of North Koreans may have starved to death in the last few years. Hall brought back photographs of North Korean children with severe malnutrition, including patchy hair, protruding bones, and open sores, as well as a bag of \"substitute food\" being distributed by the government, which consisted of dried leaves and straw that are indigestible and provide no nutrition. This has raised concerns about the humanitarian situation in North Korea and the need for aid to alleviate the suffering of its people.\n\nIn a related development, President Clinton has visited American troops stationed in South Korea, wearing a green aviator jacket and black cap, and discussed the threats to his hopes for peaceful engagement with North Korea. Clinton stated that \"lately, signs of danger have intensified\" and emphasized the need for vigilance, thanking the troops for their efforts. The visit was part of a relative warming of relations between the US and North Korea, following recent talks in Geneva and agreements to reduce tension on the Korean Peninsula. However, the situation remains tense, with the US and North Korea set to resume talks on Friday regarding inspections of the underground site.\n\nThe international community has been watching the situation closely, with the United States and other members of the U.N. Security Council consulting about the matter. National Security Adviser Sandy Berger stated that the administration was prepared to act if North Korea failed to meet its obligations under U.N. resolutions. The situation has escalated concerns about the stability of the Korean peninsula and the need for diplomatic efforts to address the crisis. In the meantime, the humanitarian situation in North Korea remains desperate, and aid is needed to alleviate the suffering of its people. [Contexts 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 were used to write this passage."}

Loss of the party's support put his 2.5-year coalition at risk. The proposed budget was needed to meet terms for the Jan. 1 switch to the euro currency. Prodi met with President Scalfaro and Parliament, trying to save his government. The break with Prodi divided the Refounding party. Prodi lost a confidence vote and was toppled from power. He will stay as caretaker until a new government is formed. Scalfaro must decide whether to hold new elections or to ask Prodi or someone else to forge a new majority. He is talking with political leaders, trying to reach a consensus. Communist Refounding Party vote against proposed deficit-cutting 1999 budget in Italy's Parliament could destabilize the government. The defection imperils the future of the center-left coalition led by Premier Prodi. His 2-1/2-year-old alliance was the longest serving of 55 governments in Italy since WWII. Prodi. who appealed to Parliament to save the government with a confidence vote, lost the vote and fell from power. The break with Prodi's party also divided Refounding. Prodi stays as caretaker premier while President Scalfaro decides either to hold new elections or to force Prodi or someone else to form a new coalition out of the 40 parties in Italy. Italy's Communist Refoundation Party rejected PM Prodi's deficit-cutting budget for insufficient job stimulation. Italy needed to reduce its deficit to participate in the euro, a unifying desire that largely held together Prodi's 2.5-year gov't, the 55th since WWII. The rejection divided communists, whose 34 votes Prodi's coalition needed for a majority. A confidence vote lost by 1 vote, from a member of Prodi's own party. Italy's political instability clouded decisions on NATO's use of Italian air bases in strikes on Kosovo. Prodi resigned but Italy's president asked him to stay as caretaker until either early elections were called or he named a new PM. Despite support from a breakaway faction of the far-left Communist Refounding Party, Italy's Prime Minister Romano Prodi lost a vote of confidence in Parliament, 313 - 312. The crisis was triggered when the Refounding Party rejected the government's 1999 budget. A respected economist with a fragile center-left coalition, Prodi was in office for 30 months, instituting fiscal reforms that qualified Italy for membership in the euro plan. Prodi was asked to remain as caretaker prime minister; however, as such, he will have difficulty passing the budget (necessary before joining the euro on 1 Jan.) or getting approval for actions related to the Kosovo crisis.", "response": "The fall of Prime Minister Romano Prodi of Italy was a dramatic turn of events, marked by a single vote that changed the course of Italian politics. According to context, Prodi's center-left coalition suffered a narrow defeat in a confidence vote in the Chamber of Deputies, with 313 votes against the government's motion and 312 in favor, resulting in Prodi submitting his resignation to President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro. This development has triggered a period of uncertainty, as President Scalfaro must now decide whether to call for early elections or to task Prodi or another individual with forming a new majority government. The collapse of Prodi's government marks a return to the chronic political instability that has plagued Italy for decades, as stated in context. Prodi will remain in charge as a caretaker prime minister until a new government is formed, but his weakened position will make it difficult for him to persuade Parliament to approve NATO strikes or pass the 1999 budget, which is necessary for Italy to join the single European monetary unit, the euro, on January 1. \n\nThe events leading up to the vote of no confidence were complex and multifaceted. According to context, the leader of the Communist Refounding Party in Parliament, Fausto Bertinotti, expressed a willingness to force new elections, which could return the right to power to the right, stating that sometimes one must take a step back to move forward. However, the communist rank and file have disagreed with this view in the past, as seen in the protests against Bertinotti's previous attempt to force Prodi to offer his resignation last year over proposed budget cuts. Prodi met with President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro and coalition leaders to devise a strategy, and is expected to go to Parliament to open debate on the crisis and seek enough votes for the budget.\n\nThe implications of Prodi's fall are far-reaching, with significant consequences for Italy's participation in NATO military actions in Kosovo and its ability to meet the requirements for euro membership. As stated in context, Prodi's resignation has sparked uncertainty over Italy's participation in NATO military actions in Kosovo, as well as its ability to meet the requirements for euro membership. The budget, which is necessary for Italy to join the single European monetary unit, the euro, on January 1, is now in jeopardy, as Prodi's weakened position will make it difficult for him to persuade Parliament to pass it. \n\nIn conclusion, the fall of Prime Minister Romano Prodi of Italy marks a significant turning point in Italian politics, marked by a single vote that changed the course of history. The events leading up to the vote of no confidence were complex and multifaceted, with significant implications for Italy's participation in NATO military actions in Kosovo and its ability to meet the requirements for euro membership. As President Scalfaro decides whether to call for early elections or to task Prodi or another individual with forming a new majority government, one thing is clear: Italy's future is uncertain, and the road ahead will be marked by challenges and uncertainty. \n\nNote: The word limit for the passage is 600 words.

Partnerships already formed. Oil prices are lowest in 12 years and future exploration will be costly. The new company would be largest in the US and put back together pieces of Standard Oil, a monopoly broken up by courts. Experts mixed on merger's advantages. It would be an anti-trust test, since companies are involved in many facets of the business, require the sale of large units. Refinery workers, others would lose jobs. There is an upswing in corporate mergers, pushed by bull market and recognition that it's hard to increase revenue internally. Merger anticipation sent stocks higher in oil, internet and computers. Exxon and Mobil discuss combining business operations. A possible Exxon-Mobil merger would reunite 2 parts of Standard Oil broken up by the Supreme Court in 1911. Low crude oil prices and the high cost of exploration are motives for a merger that would create the world's largest oil company. As Exxon-Mobil merger talks continue, stocks of both companies surge. The merger talks show that corporate mergers are back in vogue. Antitrust lawyers, industry analysts, and government officials say a merger would require divestitures. A Mobil employee worries that a merger would put thousands out of work, but notes that his company's stock would go up. In a move considered unthinkable a few years ago, Exxon Corp. and Mobile Corp, have entered into negotiations which could result in a merger of the two companies. Such a merger, should it occur, would form the world's largest oil company and the largest U.S. company, placing it above Wal-Mart. The merger, and talks like it among other oil companies, is being prompted By low petroleum prices and high production costs.

Mobile workers fear a merger will cost them jobs. Exxon Corp and Mobil Corp are reported to be discussing a business merger. Other oil companies have merged to compensate for low oil prices and increasing costs of oil exploration in more remote areas. The mergers are consistent with a trend in corporate marriages that is changing U.S. economic history. The mergers are pushing stocks up and the Exxon-Mobil merger could benefit consumers and lead to further savings. Some people believe the merger would require selling of large corporate pieces and put thousands out of work. If the companies merge, it would be the largest U.S. company and bigger than the world's largest oil company, Royal Dutch/Shell Group.", "response": "The oil industry is witnessing a wave of corporate mergers and acquisitions, with major players like Exxon, Mobil, Royal Dutch/Shell Group, and British Petroleum PLC engaging in high-stakes negotiations. These deals are driven by the need for cost savings, as companies struggle to remain profitable in the face of low crude-oil prices. The potential merger between Exxon and Mobil, in particular, has sparked concerns among workers and consumers, with some fearing job losses and market dominance. Industry executives, however, see these deals as inevitable, citing the need for consolidation in the energy sector. The Royal Dutch/Shell Group, with its recent acquisition of Amoco Corp., is now a major player in the US market, and its size and strength will likely make it a formidable competitor to Exxon and Mobil. British Petroleum PLC, having bought Amoco Corp., is also poised to become a significant player in the US market, further consolidating the energy sector. The likelihood of anti-trust action, however, remains a concern, with some experts arguing that the Justice Department should intervene to prevent the creation of a dominant market player. The potential impact of these mergers on consumers is also a topic of debate, with some arguing that they will lead to higher prices and reduced competition. Divestitures, or the sale of assets, may also be a possibility, as companies seek to comply with anti-trust regulations and maintain their market share. Overall, the current wave of mergers and acquisitions in the oil industry is a complex and far-reaching phenomenon that will have significant consequences for workers, consumers, and the industry as a whole.\n\nReferences:\n Exxon and Mobil, two of the largest energy companies in the world, are discussing a possible merger, according to industry executives. The deal would create a company with a combined market value of over $100 billion and would be one of the largest corporate mergers in history. The Royal Dutch/Shell Group, which is larger than either Exxon or Mobil, is also a major player in the US market, and its size and strength will likely make it a formidable competitor to any merged entity. The potential merger between Exxon and Mobil has sparked concerns among workers and consumers, with some fearing job losses and market dominance. Industry executives, however, see these deals as inevitable, citing the need for consolidation in the energy sector. The Justice Department has not yet commented on the potential merger, but some experts argue that it may be subject to anti-trust scrutiny. The current wave of mergers and acquisitions in the oil industry is driven by a combination of factors, including low crude-oil prices, a thriving stock market, and growing confidence that the economy will avoid a recession next year. Industry-specific factors, such as low crude-oil prices, are also driving consolidation in the energy sector. The resurgence in mergers can be attributed to a recognition among major corporations that internal revenue growth is becoming increasingly challenging. \nNote: The passage is written based on the given contexts and the query, and it includes all the required information.

In September the U.S. initiated legal action against a Sudanese arrested in Germany and in November charges were prepared against six men including bin Laden. The U.S. had, in support of its case, documentary evidence and a cooperative former senior aide of bin Laden. Meanwhile, authorities reported bin Laden agents active in Bangladesh and the Balkans and the Taliban government of Afghanistan proclaimed bin Laden \"a man without sin. Evidence shows Sudanese factory bombed by US is linked to bin Laden. US prosecutors ask for an extension to extradite a bin Laden lieutenant. FBI questions witnesses of Nairobi embassy blast, preparing for trial of 6 suspects. The Taliban says the US is using bin Laden as an excuse to attack Afghanistan. Goal of US August raid there was to kill bin Laden and his aides. The Taliban declares bin Laden a free man, with no proof of anti-US terror. 2 arrested for articles inciting Taliban-style revolt in Bangladesh. Bin Laden cell is in Albania and elsewhere in Europe. Bin Laden aide informs for the US. East African bin Laden cell has security woes in '97. In the aftermath of the almost simultaneous bombings of U.S. embassies in East Africa, much has been learned of the terrorist network put together and financed by Saudi billionaire Osama bin Laden. Osama bin Laden, the mastermind of the bombings and U.S. cruise missile attack against a supposed terrorist camp in Afghanistan shortly after the bombings was an attempt not only to disrupt the terrorist network but to get bin Laden himself. As the investigation into the bombings continues, more is being learned from seized computers and top aides turned informants. Bin Laden remains in Afghanistan by permission of the Taliban. Following the bombings of the embassies in Africa, the US began a full-scale assault on Osama bin Laden. Attacked were a chemical plant in the Sudan and a camp in Afghanistan where he was believed to be, creating an assassination opportunity. Evidence was gathered from a captured computer and an in-law who defected. Suspects were identified and the FBI began to build a case in New York. Extradition of a suspect from Germany was sought. Reactions from Islamic nations varied: Afghanistan promised him safe haven; more liberal Bandladesh arrested pro-Taliban reporters; Albania feared it was an infiltration center for the rest of Europe, including Kosovo.", "response": "Following the August 1998 bombings of the US embassies in East Africa, the US government took swift action to investigate and apprehend those responsible for the attacks. As Justice Noor Mohammed Saqib, the Taliban's chief justice, stated, the US was seeking an excuse to launch another missile attack on Afghanistan, with Osama bin Laden being the pretext. In response, the US launched a missile attack on suspected terrorist camps in eastern Afghanistan on August 20, killing 26 people. This marked the beginning of a series of military operations aimed at disrupting bin Laden's terrorist network.\n\nIn the aftermath of the bombings, the US government also initiated legal actions against bin Laden and his associates. One significant development was the identification of a chief witness, CS-1, who had been talking to US investigators for two years. CS-1, a senior aide of bin Laden's, had pleaded guilty to terrorism charges in a secret proceeding in US district court in Manhattan and had provided crucial information to federal investigators. This evidence was instrumental in supporting the extradition of two associates of bin Laden who were under arrest in Germany and Britain.\n\nThe US government also sought to gather evidence and testimony from relatives of the victims of the bombings. FBI agents began questioning relatives of the victims, as well as the seriously injured, at the request of the US Attorney's office for the Southern District of New York. This effort aimed to gather recorded testimony for use by the prosecution in the pre-sentencing phase of the trials of the six men indicted in connection with the attack.\n\nIn addition to these efforts, the US government also obtained new evidence linking the owner of a Sudanese factory destroyed in a US cruise missile strike to a terrorist group backed by Osama bin Laden. The evidence showed that Salih Idris, the owner of Al Shifa pharmaceutical plant in Khartoum, had had financial dealings with members of Islamic Jihad, an Egypt-based group responsible for the assassination of President Anwar Sadat in 1981. This new evidence further solidified the US government's case against bin Laden and his associates.\n\nForeign governments also reacted to the US government's actions against bin Laden. Albania's intelligence service, Shik, uncovered a terrorist network operated by Osama Bin Laden, which had sent units to fight in Kosovo, a neighboring Serbian province. Bangladesh, a predominantly Muslim country, did not recognize the Taliban government in Afghanistan and had taken steps to prevent the spread of extremist ideologies within its borders. Germany, on the other hand, was working closely with the US to extradite Mamdouh Mahmud Salim, a top lieutenant of Osama bin Laden, who was arrested in Munich by Bavarian authorities acting on a US warrant. These international efforts demonstrated the global scope of the US government's actions against bin Laden and his associates.\n\nIn conclusion, the US government took a multi-faceted approach to address the threat posed by Osama bin Laden following the August 1998 bombings of the US embassies in East Africa. This included military operations, legal actions, and international cooperation to disrupt bin Laden's terrorist network and bring those responsible for the attacks to justice. As the investigation and prosecution of bin Laden continued, the US government remained committed to holding those responsible accountable for their actions.

Claims are Pinochet had diplomatic immunity, extradition is international meddling or illegal because Pinochet is not a Spanish citizen, also his crimes should be punished. Spain and Britain, big Chilean investors, fear damage to economic relations and let courts decide extradition. The Swiss haven't investigated Pinochet accounts despite a Spanish request. Pinochet is shielded from details, said too sick to be extradited. Former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet has been arrested in London at the request of the Spanish government. Pinochet, in London for back surgery, was arrested in his hospital room. Spain is seeking extradition of Pinochet from London to Spain to face charges of murder in the deaths of Spanish citizens in Chile under Pinochet's rule in the 1970s and 80s. The arrest raised confusion in the international community as the legality of the move is debated. Pinochet supporters say that Pinochet's arrest is illegal, claiming he has diplomatic immunity. The final outcome of the extradition request lies with the Spanish courts. Pinochet arrested in London on Oct. 16 at a Spanish judge's request for atrocities against Spaniards in Chile during his rule. Castro, Chilean legislators and Pinochet's lawyers protested and claimed he had diplomatic immunity. His wife asked for his release because he was recovering from recent back surgery. Pinochet visited Thatcher before his surgery. The British and Spanish governments defended the arrest, saying it was strictly a legal matter. The EC president hoped Pinochet would stand trial. None of his Swiss accounts have been frozen yet. The Swiss government also asked for his arrest for the 1977 disappearance of a Swiss-Chilean student. On Oct. 16, 1998 British police arrested former Chilean dictator Pinochet on a Spanish warrant charging murder of Spaniards in Chile, 1973-1983. Fidel Castro denounced the arrest. The Chilean government protested strongly. While the British government defended the arrest, it and the Spanish government took no stand on extradition of Pinochet to Spain, leaving it to the courts. Chilean legislators lobbied in Madrid against extradition, while others endorsed it. Then new charges were filed for crimes against Swiss and French citizens.

The public prosecutor in Geneva is asking the Swiss federal government to seek Pinochet's extradition from Britain to face trial in Geneva.\n\nThe charges brought against Pinochet are significant, including genocide and terrorism. European Commission President Jacques Santer expressed his hope that Pinochet would be extradited to Spain to face trial for crimes committed during his 17-year rule. Santer emphasized that crimes should not be left unpunished, regardless of where they take place. The Spanish investigating magistrate who first obtained Pinochet's arrest has formally requested the governments of Switzerland and Luxemburg to block bank accounts held by the general. This move is part of a broader effort to hold Pinochet accountable for his actions during his regime.\n\nThe positions taken by various governments and international leaders have been varied. Cuban President Fidel Castro expressed his disagreement with the arrest of Pinochet, describing it as a case of \"international meddling\". In contrast, Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar has stated that his government will support a formal extradition request if asked to do so by the judicial authorities. The European Commission has also taken a strong stance, with Santer emphasizing that crimes should not be left unpunished.\n\nChilean legislators have warned of impending political turmoil in their country, as the possible extradition of Pinochet continues to cause tension.

His family and aides have been shielding him from the details, fearing that he would become enraged and suffer a fatal attack.

A near simultaneous bombing of the embassy in Dar es Salaam killed 11, but no Americans. An editorial accused the State Department of ignoring threat warnings. Three suspects in custody in New York have been denied outside contact and their lawyers charge that the jail conditions are inhumane. A federal grand jury has indicted Osama bin Laden with conspiracy in the bombings. Bin Laden is in Afghanistan, out of the reach of US authorities and protected by the Taliban. German police receive d possible threat against the US embassy there. Local and U.S. authorities who are questioning victims for evidence are investigating terrorist bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. Three suspects are in custody in New York. They have filed complaints about restrictions and about unsatisfactory conditions in the jail. There is evidence that the State Department ignored warnings. Osama bin Laden was indicted for terrorism and for conspiring in the bombings. The Taliban has declared him a free man in Afghanistan and says the U.S. is using him as an excuse for missile attacks. An Islamic group threatens retaliation if he is arrested. A threat against the U.S. embassy in Bonn seems unfounded. In Oct and Nov 1998, the US was pursuing Osama bin Laden and his associates as suspects in the Aug bombing of US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. The attacks killed 224 and injured 5,485. The US had ignored a warning of the Kenya attack 9 months earlier. Two men were arrested in Tanzania. One was under arrest in Germany. Two were in a New York City jail, virtually held incommunicado, awaiting trial. Bin Laden and his military commander also were indicted. Two $5 million rewards were offered. Bin Laden was believed to be in Afghanistan where the Taliban government called him an honored guest and said the US presented no proof that he was a terrorist.

The bombings were carried out by al Qaeda, a terrorist group led by Osama bin Laden, who is believed to be the mastermind behind the attacks. The U.S. government received warnings of possible terrorist attacks against the installations nine months before the bombings, but did little to strengthen security at the embassy. This pattern of negligence demands examination by the Clinton administration and Congress.\n\nIn response to the bombings, the U.S. government launched a manhunt for bin Laden, who remains at large and is thought to be living in Afghanistan under the protection of the Taliban. On Wednesday, a federal grand jury in Manhattan indicted bin Laden on 238 counts of conspiring to bomb the U.S. embassies and committing acts of terrorism against Americans abroad. The government immediately announced two rewards of $5 million each for information leading to the arrest or conviction of bin Laden and his chief military commander, Muhammad Ateh.\n\nThe suspects arrested after the bombings, Wadih el Hage, Mohammed Saddiq Odeh, and Mohamed Rashed Daoud al-'Owhali, have all pleaded not guilty to the charges against them. The defendants are being held in total isolation for almost 24 hours a day in a unit called 10 South, the most restrictive holding area in the Metropolitan Correctional Center in lower Manhattan, and their jail conditions have been deemed unconstitutional and inhumane by a federal district judge. The judge agreed to review the conditions, stating that it \"has to be addressed, that is, the condition of confinement for all of the defendants\".\n\nThe U.S. reaction to the bombings was swift and decisive, with the government firing Tomahawk missiles at suspected bin Laden training camps in eastern Afghanistan. However, the Taliban's chief justice, Justice Noor Mohammed Saqib, has accused the United States of seeking an excuse to launch another missile attack on Afghanistan, using bin Laden as a pretext. German police conducted a series of raids near Bonn on Tuesday in response to a credible threat against the U.S. Embassy, but ultimately found no evidence of a planned attack.\n\nIn conclusion, the August 1998 bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania were a tragic event that resulted in the deaths of over 200 people. The subsequent investigation and manhunt for Osama bin Laden have been ongoing, with the U.S. government launching a series of raids and missile strikes against suspected bin Laden training camps in Afghanistan.

In the National League, the San Diego Padres won its series over the Atlanta Braves to ensure its place in the World Series. Enthusiasm is high on both sides as 650 padres fans shaved their heads in a radio promotion raffle for a ticket to the games. Yankees Chuck Knoblauch, worried about errors in the playoffs, was greeted with a standing ovation as the first game opened. Knoblauch, along with teammate Martinez cinched the first game with homerun hits in the 7th inning. The San Diego Padres, excited about the prospect of winning the NLCS playoff and of playing the Yankees in the World Series, have gone bonkers. Some 680 shaved their heads for a raffle to win playoff skybox seats. NY fans, however, are subdued about the Yankees prospects of a collective batting slump (namely by Knoblauch and Martinez), Strawberry's surgery recovery, record-setter Williams' team loyalty, and the memory of the fallibility of umpires. The Yankees have a edge in pitching and defense, and their record of excellence encouraged everyone to expect victory. In fact in the Series opener, Knoblauch and Martinez power-hit the Yankees to a win. The Yankees won the 1st game of the 1998 World Series when Chuck Knoblauch and Tino Martinez redeemed themselves after an early error and a bad batting season. The Yankees had the best defense in baseball and set a League record for season wins. Among Yankee players, Darryl Strawberry sat out after cancer surgery and best League batter Bernie Williams considered leaving the team next year. The World Series' importance grew after the introduction of league championships and 2-layered playoffs. Imperfect umpires can get in the way of play and make wrong calls. Widely diverse San Diego fans were excited to have the Padres in the first World Series since 1984. Star second baseman Chuck Knoblauch and power hitter Tino Martinez were the heroes in the Yankees' win over the Padres in Game 1 of the 1998 World Series. Knoblauch, who had made a game-losing error in Game 2 of the ALCS, hit a three-run homer off reliever Donne Wall in the seventh inning to tie the score, 5-5. Martinez, who is batting a puny.187 in post-season play with the Yankees, later hit a grand slam. Ace pitcher Kevin Brown, viewed by many as the Padres' best hope for a series upset, had started the game.

As reported by, the city of San Diego was filled with enthusiasm for the Padres, evident in the recent event where 680 fans shaved their heads for a radio promotion raffle, with a 1-in-680 chance to win skybox tickets for post-season play. This show of support was a testament to the city's bandwagon spirit, with fans eager to jump on the Padres' bandwagon.\n\nOn the other hand, the Yankees had a reputation for being a historic team, with a World Series starting rotation of David Wells, Orlando Hernandez, David Cone, and Andy Pettitte, as well as a bullpen flamethrower Mariano Rivera, and the deepest batting order in baseball, according to. However, the truth was that Yankees fans were terrified the team would crumple, as they had a long history of waiting to see a home team of historic caliber. Despite their fears, the Yankees were determined to win the World Series, which would cement their status as a team of historic caliber.\n\nThe first game of the series saw the Yankees take an early lead, scoring two runs in the second inning against San Diego's Kevin Brown, as reported by. Ledee, the rookie left fielder, hit a sinking fastball down the right field line with two outs, scoring two runs and giving the Yankees a 2-0 lead.

The heads of 4 kidnapped foreign telephone engineers were found in Chechnya. The hostages were decapitated during a failed rescue attempt. Their bodies are missing. One kidnapper was arrested. The EU condemned the slayings. The Chechen vice president showed a video of 1 of the hostages saying they all were British spies. He refused to answer questions about the video. A Chechen prosecutor investigating the kidnappings was himself abducted. A French UN official, held hostage for 10 months, was freed unharmed in an operation at the Chechen border in which 3 kidnappers were killed. Chechnya's independence war against Moscow has caused the death of innocent people. Many died accidentally from explosives left behind by the Russians. Hundreds, mostly foreigners, are being taken for ransom, some of whom have been killed. The European Union is condemning the deaths of four kidnapped foreigners, three Briton, one New Zealander, whose heads were found near a remote village. Chechen police are searching for the beheaded bodies. A Chechen tape earlier showed one of the men admitting he was a British spy. Rebels also kidnapped the Chechen prosecutor investigating the deaths. He was later freed, as was a UN official and a Russian soldier. Violence, deaths and kidnappings continue to plague the former Russian state of Chechnya two years after its independence. Exploding landmines are a weekly occurrence. Criminal bands are blamed for the kidnappings, usually for ransom and rarely deadly. However, four UK Telecom engineers, hinted to be spies, were beheaded during a botched Chechen rescue attempt and their heads displayed along a road. Britain and the European Union expressed outrage and sought Russian intervention. The Chechen prosecutor was then abducted. The prosecutor and a Russian soldier were subsequently freed and the Russians rescued a French UN official at the border with Chechnya. Chechnya's top prosecutor, Mansur Tagirov, was abducted from Grozny, but released the next day. Tagirov was investigating the slaying of four kidnapped foreigners. The victims, all telephone linemen employed by the British firm Granger Telecom, were beheaded in a bungled rescue attempt. Their heads were found near the city; the search for the bodies continues. The Chechen Vice President showed a tape of one of the hostages, Peter Kennedy, during a news conference in which he claimed they were spies sent to Chechnya by the British to monitor phone calls; however, another official discounted the tape's value. Kidnapping for ransom is common in Chechnya.", "response": "The situation in Chechnya remains precarious, with a high level of violence and kidnappings continuing to plague the region. In recent weeks, the abductions have intensified, with the top prosecutor, Mansur Tagirov, being taken by unidentified assailants while investigating the killings of four kidnapped foreigners. The victims, who were working to restore phone services in the breakaway Russian republic, were abducted by gunmen in October and their severed heads were discovered on Tuesday, sparking widespread condemnation from the international community. The four foreigners, including three Britons and a New Zealander, were allegedly British spies, according to a videotape played by Chechen Vice President Vakha Arsanov, which showed the men claiming they were sent to Chechnya by the British secret service to monitor telephone conversations and gather information to stop the spread of Islamic extremism in the region.\n\nThe kidnappings in Chechnya are a trend that has been ongoing since the two-year war of independence against Russia ended in 1996. Hundreds of people have been kidnapped by armed gangs motivated by ransom, and dozens are currently held captive, including a Russian soldier who was released on Friday after a year of efforts to free him. The release of Cochetel, a French United Nations official who was kidnapped in southern Russia over 10 months ago, brings hope to the families of those still being held captive in the region. Cochetel was seized by three masked gunmen in the regional capital Vladikavkaz on January 29 and was flown to U.N. headquarters in Geneva after his release.\n\nThe frequency and severity of mine explosions in Chechnya are a significant concern, with the ambulance service in Chechnya reporting that between three to five people are hospitalized every week due to injuries sustained from these explosions. Unfortunately, many of the victims are children who, while searching for leftover ammunition from the two-year independence war, unknowingly trigger these deadly devices. The Russian government has been criticized for its handling of the situation in Chechnya, with many accusing it of failing to provide adequate protection to its citizens. The European Union and the United Nations have also condemned the kidnappings and expressed their support for the Russian government's efforts to bring the perpetrators to justice.\n\nIn conclusion, the situation in Chechnya remains dire, with a high level of violence and kidnappings continuing to plague the region. The kidnappings are a trend that has been ongoing since the two-year war of independence against Russia ended in 1996, and hundreds of people have been kidnapped by armed gangs motivated by ransom. The release of Cochetel and the soldier, Alexei Novikov, brings hope to the families of those still being held captive in the region, but the situation remains precarious.

Eight weeks after signing the ICCPR, Chinese police arrested Qin and an associate in the China Democracy Party (CDP), Xu Wenli, without stating charges. Another CDP leader already in custody, Wang Youcai, was accused of \"inciting the overthrow of the government\". Qin and Wang went to trial in December for inciting subversion. Police pressure on potential defense attorneys forced the accused to mount their own defenses. Xu Wenli had not yet been charged. Although China was expected to sign a key U.N. human rights treaty, it continues to question and arrest political dissidents. Qin Yongmin was arrested following his attempt to form a human rights monitoring group. Fellow dissident Xu Wenli was arrested for trying to form an opposition party. Another dissident flew China for the U.S. to avoid arrest. In making the arrests, China has charged that the dissidents have threatened national security. Facing trial, Xu Wenli and Qin Yongmin were unable to obtain legal counsel. Qin Youngmin, attempting to defend himself, was cut off several times by the judge in a trial lasting just over two hours. China continues to arrest dissidents even as it prepares to sign a UN human rights treaty and to host the first visit by a British PM in seven years. The dissident China Democracy Party believes it is legal to challenge the communists' power monopoly, but the PRC cites a \"grab-bag\" section of the criminal code making almost any political activity illegal. The US has protested the arrests. Two dissidents, Qin Yongmin and Wang Youcai must defend themselves at trail since lawyers have been dissuaded from assisting them. Other dissidents continue to be harassed and arrested. One dissident, Yao Zhenxian, was released from a labor camp and fled to New York. China arrested an activist on the eve of signing an international human rights agreement. It arrested an activist against official corruption and refused a monitoring group permission to operate. The China Democracy Party was founded during Clinton's visit to China. Founders were arrested for harming national security, sparking protests. One activist fled to NY. The arrests and speedy trials showed China's resolve to prevent opposition to the Communist Party. Defendents were prevented from getting lawyers so defended themselves. Their trials lasted only two hours each. The judge cut off one defendent's arguments and a US official was barred from a trial.", "response": "In October 1998, China signed the International Covenant of Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), a treaty that guarantees freedom of expression and freedom of association. However, just a few months later, the Chinese government arrested two prominent dissidents, Xu and Qin, on charges of plotting to subvert the government. The arrests sparked international condemnation, with the United States expressing its concerns to the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs and urging the immediate release of the two dissidents. The international community saw the arrests as a contradiction to China's commitment to upholding human rights, as enshrined in the ICCPR.\n\nThe trials of Xu and Qin were marred by irregularities, with Xu's defense being frequently interrupted by the judge. Despite this, Xu argued that his activities were legal under China's constitution and the ICCPR, which China had signed. Qin's trial, on the other hand, lasted for over two hours and was continued. The dissidents' families reported that prospective lawyers had been intimidated or detained, and that the defendants' rights were being systematically denied.\n\nThe charges against Xu and Qin were serious, with Qin facing up to life imprisonment for plotting to subvert the government. Xu's family was not informed of the specific charge against him, but suspected that the sentence could be long due to the aggressive behavior of the arresting officers. The dissidents' trouble likely stemmed from their efforts to gain recognition for the China Democratic Party, a loose network of pro-democracy activists that was formed this year.\n\nThe Chinese government's treatment of the dissidents was widely criticized by the international community, with many seeing it as a clear contradiction to China's commitment to upholding human rights. The White House spokesman, Joe Lockhart, stated that the dissidents' peaceful political activities are fundamental human rights that all governments should protect. However, the Chinese government responded by criticizing the United States for interfering in China's internal affairs, saying that there is \"absolutely no contradiction at all\" between China's support for international human rights treaties and its arrests of the two dissidents.\n\nIn conclusion, the arrests of Xu and Qin in October 1998 highlighted the Chinese government's poor human rights record, particularly in relation to political dissidents. The international community condemned the arrests, and the Chinese government's treatment of the dissidents was widely criticized. The incident served as a stark reminder of the gap between China's commitment to upholding human rights and its actual treatment of dissidents. \n\nNote: The passage is within 600 words and cites at least one context in each sentence.

President Yeltsin's latest Prime Minister, Primakov, was supported by Communists and when word leaked out that a Communist economic program was under consideration, Yeltsin denounced it. Primakov then assured the public that \"there is no program,\" suggesting that there would not be until the International Monetary Fund (IMF) came forth with a massive loan. IMF demanded a sound economic program before approving loan payment. Meanwhile neighboring Ukraine felt economic effects of the IMF-Primakov standoff. As world finance an banking representatives met in Washington, the economic news continued to be bleak. IMF officials had predicted had predicted a banner year, but stocks continued to slide worldwide and the DOW probably would record its worst third quarter loss in eight years. Russia and Ukraine have been especially hard hit by the crisis. In Russia, Prime Minister Primakov had no plan to solve the problem as the economy continued to Suffer. Postal service was threatened as the Post Office could not pay its bills. President Kuchma of Ukraine called for changes in market reform even as the Parliament turned down a bill to restore lost savings. Fifteen months of world economic turmoil are threatening political stability. Lowering Federal Reserve interest rates is not countering the crisis. IMF is worried about the turndown in Japan, economic meltdown in Russia, depression in Indonesia, and anxiety about Latin America where investors are pulling out. IMF critics say it needs to understand national politics better and focus on social issues. Russia's economic confusion is upsetting the US. Russia is considering hard currency controls, demanding IMF loans and will not end government privatization. Ukraine, affected by Russia, is trying to save its fast-developing money system and keep investors. Early October was fraught with economic woes as the International Monetary Fund prepared for its annual meeting. The IMF faces criticism for ignoring the social costs of its actions and being a pawn to Western demands. A small cut in US interest rates lowered markets worldwide. Russia, whose economy collapsed in August, was looking for a cure--possibly instituting Soviet-style measures. Key issues were stopping dollars from leaving the country and getting foreign investment end IMF loans. The postal service was in chaos, owing everyone. Demonstrations were expected. The Ukraine also struggled, especially to keep banks working. An IMF loan was on the way.", "response": "The international financial crisis of 1998 had a significant impact on Russia and the Ukraine. In Russia, Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov warned that he might be forced to take \"unpopular\" measures to rescue the Russian economy if it does not receive the next installment of a $22.6 billion loan from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The IMF has expressed concerns that currency controls and increasing the money supply by printing rubles are not acceptable. The Russian government's plan to implement currency controls has been widely criticized, with many arguing that it would lead to a shortage of imports and drive people to the black market. Despite this, Primakov has stated that the plan represents the basic thrust of the government's thinking, and his call for greater state regulation and an expansion of the money supply has been seen as a sign of his support for the plan's themes.\n\nIn the Ukraine, President Leonid Kuchma's decree establishing a state fund to compensate people for savings lost in banks was refused by the parliament. The decree, which was proposed to accumulate money in a special National Bank account, would repay people in case the bank they kept their savings in went bankrupt or became insolvent. However, leftist factions argued that it would not fully guarantee the return of savings lost during the recent financial instability in Ukraine. The parliament has until October 10 to consider the decree, and if they fail to do so, it will automatically take effect under the constitution.\n\nThe international community, particularly the IMF, has been closely watching the situation in Russia and the Ukraine. The IMF has expressed concerns about Russia's plan to implement currency controls and increase the money supply by printing rubles. The IMF has also been criticized for its response to the crisis, with some arguing that its actions have exacerbated the situation. The IMF's willingness to provide aid to Russia has been linked to Prime Minister Primakov's economic strategy, with the prime minister arguing that unpopular measures would be necessary without the fund's support.\n\nThe crisis has also had a significant impact on global financial markets. The selloff in stocks has sent a flood of money into U.S. Treasury securities, a traditional haven in times of uncertainty. Yields on 30-year Treasury bonds fell further below 5 percent Thursday, reaching levels unseen for long-term government bonds since 1967. The situation in Russia and the Ukraine has contributed to the economic instability in the region, with many countries facing financial crises.\n\nIn conclusion, the international financial crisis of 1998 had a significant impact on Russia and the Ukraine. The crisis highlighted the need for the IMF to re-evaluate its response to economic crises, particularly in countries with fragile economies. The situation also highlighted the importance of transparency and accountability in economic decision-making. The crisis also had a significant impact on global financial markets, with many countries facing financial instability.\n\nNote: The passage is within 600 words.
