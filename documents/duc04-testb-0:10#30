There is immediate fear due to an anti-abortion gunman believed to be at large, and long-term anxiety as access to abortions may be diminishing. The sniper's timing is speculated to be linked to Remembrance Day, as some anti-abortion activists use this day to commemorate aborted fetuses. Since 1994, a sniper has fired into the home of a Canadian doctor who performs abortions three times, wounding the target each time. These attacks are believed to be linked to shootings of abortion-providing doctors in upstate New York, including the slaying of Dr. Barnett Slepian."}
