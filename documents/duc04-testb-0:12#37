They claim to have known Weslin for some time and describe him as a man of peace who has dedicated his life to the anti-abortion cause. Weslin has been a leader in the movement for over 25 years and has founded a home for unwed mothers. His commitment to the cause has earned him the respect and admiration of fellow activists, who see him as a humble and selfless individual who is willing to make sacrifices for his beliefs."}
