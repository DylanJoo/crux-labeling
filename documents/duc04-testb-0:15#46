An itinerant antiabortion activist with a last known address in Vermont, Kopp is the subject of warrants on both sides of the border. In Canada, he is suspected of administrative violations of immigration law, while in the United States, he is wanted as a material witness in the Slepian case. The authorities are also exploring potential links between the package and four similar attacks in western New York and Canada since 1994."}
