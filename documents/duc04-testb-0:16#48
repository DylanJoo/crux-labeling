{"id": "duc04-testb-0:16#48", "contents": "James Kopp, a 44-year-old man, is being sought by the FBI as a material witness in the sniper slaying of Dr. Barnett Slepian. He is known to abortion rights leaders as an aggressive anti-abortion protester and has been arrested several times in demonstrations at abortion clinics. Kopp has a history of being involved in increasingly abrasive protests at abortion clinics, and his actions have earned him the nickname \"Atomic Dog\" among investigators. This nickname links him to the violent fringe of the anti-abortion movement, which has been responsible for a series of bombings, arsons, and murders of abortion providers over the last five years."}
