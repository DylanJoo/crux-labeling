Paul Schenck threw himself in front of Slepian's car as he arrived at the clinic, shouting insults and attempting to block his path. Despite the challenges and intimidation, Slepian remained committed to his work and continued to provide care to his patients. His attempts to separate the abortion conflict from his private life were not always successful, but he remained determined to stand by his beliefs and provide the care that he believed was necessary."}
