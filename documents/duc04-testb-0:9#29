Many private doctors in Manhattan perform abortions as part of their services, and the major concern is the impending shortage of adequately trained physicians. The introduction of the RU-486 pill, expected to receive final federal approval next year, is anticipated to significantly change the abortion landscape. The pill has been shown to reduce the number of surgical abortions in countries where it has been introduced, offering a potential solution to the decreasing availability of abortion services."}
