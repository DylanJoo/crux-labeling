The opening was stipulated by the accords brokered by U.S. President Bill Clinton at Wye River, Maryland in October. However, since then, tensions have risen between Israel and the Palestinians. Israel has accused the Palestinians of failing to contain anti-Israel violence and has frozen the accords. The Palestinians, in turn, accuse Israel of reneging on an agreement to release Palestinians jailed for anti-Israel activities."}
