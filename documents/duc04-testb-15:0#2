Wyoming Governor Jim Geringer appealed to lawmakers to reconsider their opposition to hate-crime laws, and the state's legislature will consider anti-bias legislation in January. The Shepard family has asked that their son's death not be used to further an agenda, and gay rights groups have respected their privacy by not attending the burial. However, they hope that the incident will lead to greater awareness and action against hate crimes."}
