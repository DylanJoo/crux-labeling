A survey of Massachusetts high school students found that 22% of gay respondents had skipped school in the past month due to safety concerns, and 31% had been threatened or injured at school in the past year. Similar studies have found that verbal and physical harassment of gay students is common, with many students reporting that they have been targeted with anti-gay slurs and jokes. The incident has sparked renewed calls for action to address the issue of anti-gay bias in schools and to promote greater understanding and acceptance of LGBTQ individuals."}
