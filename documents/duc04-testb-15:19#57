Instead, these laws serve as a deterrent to attacks on minorities by sending a clear message that society does not tolerate such behavior. Levin emphasized that the goal is to prevent minor crimes from escalating into more severe ones, citing the murders of homosexuals as preventable crimes that occur when offenders are not punished for their initial actions."}
