Beatrice Dorhn, legal director of the Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund, argued that Shepard's death was not just the result of isolated individuals, but rather a symptom of a broader societal problem. She emphasized that the constant message that gay people are not worthy of equal treatment contributes to a culture that enables such violence, and that Shepard's death serves as a warning to others who may be targeted simply for being open about their sexual orientation."}
