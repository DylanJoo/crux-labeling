However, upon returning the call, she discovered that she would have to pay her own way if the committee were to meet, and that as an honorary chairman, she would be part of a committee composed entirely of honorary chairmen. Furthermore, the speaker's office requested a donation of $500 to $1,000 to \"help our efforts\" in electing a bigger Republican majority in the House of Representatives."}
