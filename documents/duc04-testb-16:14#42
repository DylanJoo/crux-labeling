The nonbinding resolution was brought to the floor by Rep. John Shimkus, R-Ill., who is of Lithuanian descent and has a constituency of Lithuanians in his hometown of Collinsville. Shimkus' goal was to highlight his support for the Baltic states' past efforts against Soviet repression. This measure is an example of how members of Congress are using their time to bring attention to personal causes while waiting for Republican leaders to reach an agreement on spending bills with the White House."}
