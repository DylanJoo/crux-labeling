For example, a measure that would require minors to notify their parents if they are seeking contraceptives from federally funded family planning clinics was brought to the floor as a way to appease conservative members. Although it passed the House, it has little chance of becoming law due to Senate opposition and a likely veto from Clinton. Nevertheless, votes like these can be used to put ideological foes on the record and can be used against them in the November election."}
