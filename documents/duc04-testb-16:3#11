He is keeping a full schedule of official duties while campaigning, assuming the role of the experienced, elected official. Voinovich dismisses Boyle's charges on his record on education, citing his endorsement by the Ohio Education Association and National Education Association. He also points out that Boyle was a member of the state Legislature during the period cited in the Supreme Court ruling and failed to address the issues. As the campaign enters its final stages, Boyle remains optimistic, despite being the underdog."}
