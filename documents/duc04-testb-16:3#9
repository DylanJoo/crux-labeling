{"id": "duc04-testb-16:3#9", "contents": "George Voinovich, a Republican, is running for the Senate seat held by retiring Democrat John Glenn. Voinovich, who is barred from seeking a third term as governor, previously won re-election with 72 percent of the vote, setting a 20th-century record for victory margins in Ohio politics. While few expect him to repeat this feat, politicians from both parties acknowledge that he is well-positioned to increase the Republican majority in the Senate. His Democratic opponent, Mary Boyle, is undertaking a vigorous campaign, despite being a relative underdog."}
