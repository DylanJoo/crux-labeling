{"id": "duc04-testb-16:5#17", "contents": "Those who support a D'Amato endorsement, including top officials within the Human Rights Campaign, contend that in the current political climate, where Congress is almost certain to remain under Republican control after November, gay people must build alliances with moderate Republicans. Human Rights Campaign officials also say their standing policy is to support friendly incumbents, even when their challengers have better voting records on gay issues. This is the case in New York, where Schumer has been a strong supporter of issues that are important to gay communities, but D'Amato has been working to reposition himself as a moderate. The lobbying efforts are hoping that the group will endorse both candidates, or make no endorsement at all, rather than endorsing D'Amato."}
