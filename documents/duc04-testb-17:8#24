The group's leader, Ramadan Abdallah Shallah, stated that the attack was in response to Israel's settlement policy and \"Judaization\" of the West Bank. A leaflet signed by the group and faxed to Reuters in Jerusalem described the attack as a \"heroic\" act aimed at confronting the \"great conspiracy\" to liquidate the Palestinian cause through the Oslo and Wye Plantation agreements. Islamic Holy War and its counterpart, Hamas, have denounced these agreements as a sellout of Palestinian rights."}
