Tom DeLay of Texas, a leading figure in the Republican effort to force Clinton from office, views the debate as a battle between moral relativism and absolute truth. He praises Rep. Bob Livingston for his understanding of the debate, which he believes is about honor, decency, integrity, and truth. Rep. DeLay dismisses arguments that the president's actions, although morally reprehensible, do not rise to the level of impeachment, labeling them as moral relativism. In contrast, Rep. Jose Serrano of New York asserts that his constituents do not hate the president, but rather love and pray for him, and that the Republicans do not have the American people's support."}
