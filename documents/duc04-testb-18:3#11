The Senate must reassure the American people that a decisive wisdom at the core of our messy-looking political system has not melted down. The editorial urges Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott to rise to the defining challenge of his career and guide the Senate toward censure negotiations. A bipartisan group of senators is discussing a censure that would involve some form of presidential confession, a fine, and a joint congressional request that Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr not prosecute Clinton in the courts. The Senate's historic reputation for prudence requires it to find appropriate punishment for a personally weak president who has damaged the rule of law, but not threatened the stability of the government."}
