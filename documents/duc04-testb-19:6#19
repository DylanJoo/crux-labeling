Once she had achieved perfect alignment, Cabana fired Endeavour's thrusters, and the brief burst raised the shuttle and Unity enough for the docking mechanisms on the two station components to snap together. The union, intended to last the station's 15-year or more lifetime, set the stage for a spacewalk by two astronauts on Monday to attach electrical connectors and cables between the two components. The six astronauts had to steer clear of a piece of space junk before beginning their final approach to Zarya, but everything occurred more or less as planned."}
