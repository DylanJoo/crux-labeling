{"id": "duc04-testb-1:14#43", "contents": "The union argued that owners should have protected themselves by inserting clauses about non-payment for lockouts and strikes into individual player contracts. In support of its arguments, the union pointed to clauses in a few individual player contracts that contained language precluding payment during a lockout. The league is relying on the basic tenets of labor law, which hold that employees not be paid during strikes or lockouts. A ruling for the union would be significant for all future negotiations between players and owners. The deterrent factor of a lockout is that employees subject to a collective bargaining agreement do not get paid once the agreement expires and they are unable to reach a new agreement."}
