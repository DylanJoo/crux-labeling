He emphasized that it was the responsibility of each yacht's skipper to decide whether to continue or retire from the race. A total of 37 yachts had already been forced out of the 1,160-kilometer race, with many losing their masts or sustaining injured crew. Campbell noted that the instructions for the race made it clear that the decision to continue or retire was up to each skipper."}
