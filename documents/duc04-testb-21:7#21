{"id": "duc04-testb-21:7#21", "contents": "A major search was under way in Bass Strait off Australia's southeast coast on Sunday night for an injured crewman swept overboard during the Sydney-to-Hobart yacht race. The Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) said it had alerted all shipping in the Strait as high winds and huge seas smash into the remnants of the 115-boat fleet. An AMSA spokesman said they were alerted that the 13-meter Sydney yacht Sword of Orion had been rolled in the heavy seas, with several crewmen being injured, including the unidentified man lost overboard. Another crewman has a broken leg. The yacht, which has a crew of 11, was halfway across Bass Strait heading towards Hobart, capital of the island state of Tasmania and the finish line in the annual race. The ANSA spokesman said search conditions were ``atrocious.''"}
