Hava Delijaj, 65, was shot and one of her feet cut with a knife so that it hung by a thread of skin. Young women and children who had run a few hundred yards up a rocky path were mowed down. Miraculously, a 6-week-old baby, Diturie, was found by her father alive in the clasp of her dead mother, Lumnije, 30, more than 24 hours after the killings. ``Blood was in her mouth and her mother's hand on the baby,'' said Imer Delijaj, the father, an avowed member of the Kosovo Liberation Army."}
