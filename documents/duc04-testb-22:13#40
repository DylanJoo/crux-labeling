Delijaj family members have reported seeing an ethnic Albanian police officer accompanying the Serbian police officers during the fighting. They believe that the police officer, who is posted at the nearby Glogovac police station, was used by the Serbian special police officers as a guide to the Obrinje area. This police officer could be an important witness for criminal investigators from the war-crimes tribunal in The Hague. Human rights experts emphasize the importance of prosecuting those responsible for the atrocities."}
