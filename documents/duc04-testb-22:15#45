The court acquitted Cmndr. Zejnil Delalic, a top military commander who oversaw the facility, of responsibility for war crimes committed at the government-run prison camp under his overall command. However, Prosecutor Grant Niemann of Australia announced that he would appeal Delalic's acquittal. Judges freed Delalic pending the outcome of the appeal. Delalic expressed his gratitude to the court, stating that the judgment had increased his trust in the institution."}
