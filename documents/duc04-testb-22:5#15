{"id": "duc04-testb-22:5#15", "contents": "Yugoslav war crimes tribunal President Gabrielle Kirk McDonald has strongly criticized the Belgrade authorities for their refusal to allow U.N. investigators to investigate alleged atrocities in Kosovo. In a letter to the United Nations Security Council, Judge McDonald described the refusal to grant visas to investigators as \"an affront\" to the Security Council and all law-abiding nations. The letter was released by the tribunal on Wednesday. The intentional and continuous refusal by Yugoslav officials to comply with their legal obligations to the tribunal is a clear breach of international law."}
