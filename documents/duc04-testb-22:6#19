While the country cooperates in cases where Serbs were victims in Bosnia and Croatia, it has questioned the tribunal's jurisdiction and refused to indict three army officers wanted for alleged war crimes in Croatia. Additionally, Yugoslavia has refused to allow U.N. investigators to probe alleged atrocities in the southern Kosovo province, where ethnic Albanian separatists are fighting government forces. Some participants, like Miodrag Mitic, a former legal adviser in Yugoslavia's foreign ministry, expressed skepticism about the tribunal's intentions, suggesting that it was influenced by powerful countries that dominate the international body."}
