{"id": "duc04-testb-23:9#29", "contents": "Sao Paulo, Brazil's industrial and financial powerhouse, is perhaps the state most critical to the success of Cardoso's austerity plans. With more than 34 million inhabitants, nearly equal to the entire population of neighboring Argentina, it alone accounts for more than one-third of Brazil's economic output and 70 of the 513 congressional seats. While incumbent governor Mario Covas, a Cardoso ally who is seeking re-election, has committed himself to the austerity plan, Covas opponent Paulo Maluf is a question mark. ``If Maluf wins, he will use his victory as a launching pad to the presidency in 2003,'' Kugelmas predicted. ``And that means he will try to stay as far away as possible from any austerity measure.''"}
