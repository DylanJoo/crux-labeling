{"id": "duc04-testb-24:0#2", "contents": "Saramago's writing style is characterized by his use of parables, imagination, compassion, and irony to explore the human condition. His works often blend recognizable settings with magical elements, earning him comparisons with Colombian writer Gabriel Garcia Marquez. The Nobel citation praised his work for enabling us to \"apprehend an elusory reality.\" Saramago's most recent book to be translated into English, \"Blindness,\" is an unsettling allegory about the social meltdown as an inexplicable blindness sweeps through society. He will receive the $978,000 prize on December 10 in Stockholm."}
