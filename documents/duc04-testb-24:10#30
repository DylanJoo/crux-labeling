{"id": "duc04-testb-24:10#30", "contents": "Portuguese novelist Jose Saramago, known for his capricious vision and imaginative storytelling, was named the winner of the 1998 Nobel Literature Prize. The Swedish Academy recognized Saramago for his work that \"with parables sustained by imagination, compassion and irony continually enables us to apprehend an elusory reality.\" His breakthrough novel, \"Baltasar and Blimunda,\" was written in 1982, and perhaps his best-known work is \"The Stone Raft,\" which tells the story of the Iberian Peninsula breaking off from Europe and floating into the Atlantic. This device allows him to comment ironically on the authorities and politicians, and his works have been translated into over 20 languages."}
