His best-known books, all published in the US, include \"Baltasar and Blimunda,\" \"The Year of the Death of Ricardo Reis,\" \"The Stone Raft,\" and \"The History of the Siege of Lisbon.\" His latest book available in English, \"Blindness,\" has been described as his \"symphonic new novel\" by Andrew Miller in The New York Times Book Review. Miller praised Saramago's work for its clear-eyed and compassionate acknowledgment of things as they are, a quality that can only be termed as wisdom."}
