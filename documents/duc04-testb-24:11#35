He was received with cheers and bouquets of roses upon his return to the fair, and later told a news conference that he was happy not only for himself but also for his country. He emphasized the importance of protecting the Portuguese language and ensuring it remains alive, rather than becoming a museum relic. The award was celebrated in Lisbon, where President Jorge Sampaio described it as \"recognition of Portuguese culture,\" while the local Communist leader, Carlos Carvalho, saw it as a credit to his own party."}
