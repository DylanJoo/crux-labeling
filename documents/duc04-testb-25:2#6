However, a quarter of a century later, the 56-year-old businessman, who also ran hotels and a tourist camp, is now broke, and the farmers group is a distant memory. The region has been ravaged by inter-tribal rivalry, looting soldiers, Rwandan refugees, and two rebellions in as many years, resulting in the loss of half a million head of cattle, a significant decline in coffee and tea exports, and the transformation of the once-bucolic eastern region into a war zone."}
