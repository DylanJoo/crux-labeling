Ignoring their psychological needs could lead to alienation and potentially harm society as a whole. Villa-Vicencio emphasized the importance of addressing the healing of perpetrators, not only for their sake but for the nation's well-being. The Truth Commission is currently probing crimes committed by all sides in the anti-apartheid struggle, and its final report is expected to be released at the end of the month."}
