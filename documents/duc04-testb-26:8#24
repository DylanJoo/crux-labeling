{"id": "duc04-testb-26:8#24", "contents": "South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission has announced that it will temporarily withhold parts of its final report that implicate former apartheid-era president F.W. de Klerk in illegal acts. De Klerk, who shared the 1993 Nobel Peace Prize with President Nelson Mandela for his role in ending the country's white supremacist government, had objected to the commission's finding that he was \"an accessory after the fact\" in the bombings of the headquarters of a church group and a labor federation in the 1980s. The commission's chairman, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, said that the decision was made with \"great reluctance\" and that the commission needed time to prepare to fight the legal challenge. De Klerk's name will be removed from the 3,500-page report to avoid delaying its release."}
