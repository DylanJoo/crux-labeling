The panel has been criticized for its perceived bias against former government officials and Afrikaners. De Klerk has previously forced the commission to court and won an apology for being called a liar. Political analysts say that the withdrawal of the findings will only further the perception that the panel lacks impartiality. The commission's report is expected to be released on Thursday, but the controversy surrounding it is likely to continue."}
