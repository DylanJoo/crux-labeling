The Bourse in Paris also announced that it would host a meeting of nine other European exchanges on November 27 to discuss the creation of a unifying and competitive pan-European equity market. This move is a response to the introduction of the euro, which is reshaping Europe's financial landscape and requiring Europeans to think in Continental rather than national terms in finance and business."}
