Kleon Papadopoulos, a 36-year-old Greek banker based in London, is a prime example. With a background in business studies in the US and Britain, Papadopoulos speaks multiple languages and has traveled extensively throughout Europe and beyond. He works for a Swiss bank in London, and his social circle is a melting pot of nationalities. Papadopoulos sees the benefits of a unified Europe, where a good government is more important than its location."}
