Pat Keegans told the crowd, many of them visibly moved. ``Be assured of this _ there is another bomb ticking _ the irresistible bomb of justice and truth. ``Be certain that our wreath-laying today is not a symbolic gesture. It is a declaration that we will not rest until we have justice and truth, until all who are responsible for your deaths are held accountable,'' he said."}
