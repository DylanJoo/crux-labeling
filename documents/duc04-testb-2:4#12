The International Olympic Committee has ordered a top-level investigation into the payment of nearly dlrs 400,000 in scholarships to relatives of IOC members by the Salt Lake group which won the bid for the 2002 Winter Games. IOC executive board member Marc Hodler said the scholarship fund _ described as ``humanitarian aid'' by Salt Lake officials _ amounted to a ``bribe.'' ``I'm terribly sorry that even Salt Lake City _ by far the best place to hold the winter games _ had to use certain methods in order to get the vote,'' Hodler said."}
