He has repeated calls for Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy to return to Cambodia, but the opposition has insisted that any further talks on the next government must take place outside the country. The ruling party has rejected allegations of intimidation and recently guaranteed opposition members' safety inside the country. Meanwhile, diplomatic efforts to revive the stalled talks have gained momentum, with Japanese Foreign Affairs Secretary of State Nobutaka Machimura announcing that King Norodom Sihanouk has called on Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy to return to Cambodia."}
