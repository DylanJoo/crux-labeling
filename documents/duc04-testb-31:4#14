{"id": "duc04-testb-31:4#14", "contents": "The scandal has also implicated other government officials, including State Minister Eyup Asik, who resigned last month after allegations surfaced of his close ties to Cakici. Cakici was arrested in France in August and Turkey has requested his extradition. The controversy has also led to the cancellation of Yigit's purchase of the mass-circulation national newspaper Milliyet, which was allegedly encouraged by Yilmaz to secure the paper's backing for his center-right Motherland party in next year's elections. The scandal has dealt a significant blow to Yilmaz's government, with opposition parties calling for his resignation and an investigation into the allegations."}
