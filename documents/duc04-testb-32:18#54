This is why evidence that has been in the Justice Department's possession for years has been added to the case since May. Initially, the older material did not seem relevant, but as new evidence was gathered, it became clear that it fit the pattern of the current case. For instance, the government has alleged that Microsoft pressured Intel Corp. to limit its development efforts in multimedia and Internet software, as they might conflict with Microsoft's plans. This alleged arm-twisting occurred during meetings between the two companies three years ago, including one on August 2, 1995, attended by Andrew Grove, Intel's chairman, and Bill Gates, Microsoft's chairman."}
