In these cases, the Supreme Court ruled that exclusionary practices that did not benefit consumers were in violation of antitrust laws. However, the courts did not provide a clear test for evaluating consumer benefits. Microsoft argues that its practices produce demonstrable consumer benefits and do not prevent consumers from installing rival software or using competing Web sites. The Justice Department, on the other hand, seeks to force Microsoft to install Netscape's browser alongside its own, citing the precedent set in Aspen Skiing."}
