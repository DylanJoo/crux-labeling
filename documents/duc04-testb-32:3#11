Roosevelt made a distinction between good trusts, which thrived due to superior efficiency, and bad trusts, which grew due to unfair business practices. The company's rivals had complained about its business practices, but during the 1880s and '90s, the price of kerosene declined steadily. However, when Standard Oil raised prices in the early 1900s, popular support for antitrust action swelled, leading to a federal suit in 1906 and the breakup of the company in 1911. Historians observe that the Standard Oil and Microsoft cases share common themes, but note that there is no presidential involvement and no real consumer dissatisfaction in the Microsoft case."}
