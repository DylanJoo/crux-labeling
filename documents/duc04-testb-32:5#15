However, the judge also ordered Microsoft to comply with the Justice Department's request to examine the company's financial records. Microsoft had argued that allowing government attorneys to access its records would be detrimental to its business operations. Nevertheless, after receiving assurances from government lawyers that their searches would be narrow and targeted, the judge ruled in favor of the Justice Department."}
