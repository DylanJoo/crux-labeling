The government points to Microsoft's efforts to pressure Intel to shelve its development of multimedia and Internet software and to limit its cooperation with Netscape. The prosecutors argue that this behavior is part of a broader pattern of Microsoft using its market power to bully competitors and partners, including Apple Computer Inc. and other companies. The government's case against Microsoft is ongoing, with the company facing allegations of violating antitrust laws and engaging in anti-competitive behavior."}
