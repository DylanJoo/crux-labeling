This move came just before critical negotiations with Palestinian leaders in the United States, and the editorial questions whether Sharon, known for being a long-time foe of the Palestinians, is truly prepared to make peace with them. The editorial suggests that much will depend on Netanyahu's ability to control his strong-willed aide, a challenge that has proven difficult for other Israeli leaders."}
