Netscape is known as the pioneer in the commercial development of software used to navigate the World Wide Web. Microsoft saw the browser software as a direct threat to its industry dominance and pursued that market aggressively. However, Netscape no longer generates revenues from its browser, which it now also distributes for free, but from the sale of heavy-duty software sold to corporations. Much of this software is used as the technological \"back office\" for electronic commerce, used in building Web sites and processing transactions."}
