According to Stephen M. Case, chairman of America Online, \"A new generation of Internet devices to be able to deliver our service anywhere is a key part of what this deal is about in the long run.\" The idea is to make America Online the standard way to get onto the Internet, with Netscape playing a crucial part in that effort. The success of the merger will depend on the ability of the companies' executives to sell this vision to Netscape's programmers."}
