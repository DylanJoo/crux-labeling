Byron Wien, U.S. equity strategist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter &AMP; Co., said that according to his calculations, stocks were about 10 percent overvalued. However, Wien also noted that the market's recovery, which has been buttressed by three cuts in interest rates by the Federal Reserve Board, has left many longtime Wall Street hands grasping for historical parallels. The market's performance has been surprising, with the Dow rising more than 24 percent since August 31, and the S&P 500-stock index up 18.54 percent for the year."}
