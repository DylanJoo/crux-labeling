It would strengthen two of Microsoft's leading rivals, AOL and Sun Microsystems, while subsuming Netscape, an Internet software maker once regarded as the most serious challenger to Microsoft's dominance of the personal computer software market. Netscape, founded in 1994, has struggled over the last 18 months under an assault from Microsoft, which entered the market aggressively and quickly matched the quality of Netscape's technology. Since then, Netscape has focused mainly on two businesses - advertising and transaction fees from its Netcenter Web site and selling industrial-strength software to corporations."}
