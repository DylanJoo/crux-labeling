Azizah Ismail, Anwar's wife, stated that the lawyers had been denied access to her husband, making it impossible for them to prepare for his defense. Anwar was arrested on September 20 under the Internal Security Act, which allows for indefinite detention without trial, after leading rallies calling for government reform and Mahathir's resignation."}
