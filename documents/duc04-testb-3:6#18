The party's supreme council, led by Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, aims to find a suitable candidate for the deputy's job, but a decision is not expected quickly due to the large number of contenders. The meeting also addressed the ban on comments about Anwar's guilt or innocence, imposed by the High Court judge. The ruling coalition had planned a rally in the capital to draw in young supporters, but the event's purpose may be reevaluated in light of the court's decision."}
