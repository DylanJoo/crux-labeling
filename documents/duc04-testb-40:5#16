However, the administration's support for protesters calling for Mahathir's removal was more unexpected. Mahathir has been a thorn in Washington's side, denouncing America and its policies, but he is not considered a threat on the same level as Saddam. The Malaysian government and U.S. companies with interests in the country criticized the administration's statement, while others praised it as a necessary call for reform. This raises the question of what criteria are used to determine when it is acceptable for the U.S. to publicly suggest that a foreign leader should step down."}
