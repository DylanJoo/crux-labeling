In addition to discussing the nuclear issue, Clinton also met with business leaders to hear their prescriptions for putting the nation's economy back on track. He praised South Korea's efforts to engage North Korea on cultural and economic fronts, citing the new tourism deal that is bringing South Koreans to the North on cruise ships. Clinton rejected the idea of compensation for inspecting the suspected nuclear site, emphasizing that cooperation and progress with America are in the North's long-term interests."}
