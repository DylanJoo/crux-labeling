This development comes on the heels of a flurry of deal-making activity, with $40.4 billion in corporate acquisitions announced or declared imminent on Monday alone. The resurgence in mergers can be attributed to a thriving stock market, the recognition among major corporations that internal revenue growth is becoming increasingly challenging, and growing confidence that the economy will avoid a recession next year. Industry-specific factors, such as low crude-oil prices, are also driving consolidation in the energy sector."}
