Exxon is a \"well run company that likes to grow its own businesses,\" while Mobil has been known for being a proud company that has said in the past that it would not want to merge. The heads of both companies, Lee Raymond and Lucio Noto, are also different personalities, which could make combining the two far-flung companies challenging. However, analysts note that \"if you offer enough money, you can make anything happen.\" Both companies are under pressure to find new fields of oil to help them survive in the long term."}
