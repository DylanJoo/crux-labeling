{"id": "duc04-testb-44:3#9", "contents": "Britain has defended the arrest of Gen. Augusto Pinochet, with Trade Secretary Peter Mandelson dismissing Chile's claim of diplomatic immunity as \"ridiculous.\" Chilean officials have strongly protested the arrest, with President Eduardo Frei criticizing the Spanish magistrate's arrest order as an attack on Chile's institutions. The British government has stated that only government officials on official business and accredited diplomats have diplomatic immunity, which does not apply to Pinochet in this case. Pinochet was arrested on Friday at a private London hospital, where he was undergoing a back operation, in response to a request from Spain to question him about allegations of murder during his rule."}
