U.S. authorities believe Salim played a key role in financing, training, and arming members of a terrorist organization, including those allegedly responsible for the embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania. In response to this threat, German police have increased security measures at U.S. installations, including the consulate in Hamburg, which received a tip about a possible threat in September."}
