{"id": "duc04-testb-45:7#21", "contents": "On Thursday, an Islamic militant group issued a threat to retaliate if Saudi dissident Osama bin Laden is arrested, describing him as a \"hero\" to Muslims worldwide. The threat was made by Omar Warsi, a leader of Pakistan's militant Sunni Muslim group, Sipah-e-Sahaba, or Guardians of the Friends of the Prophet. Bin Laden, believed to be in Afghanistan, and a top aide were indicted by a U.S. District Court for their alleged involvement in the U.S. embassy bombings in Africa. The indictment accuses them of conspiring to kill Americans outside the United States. The State Department has also announced a reward of up to $5 million for bin Laden's capture. Warsi's group has been blamed for the killings of hundreds of Shiite Muslims in Pakistan, whom they revile as non-Muslims based on a centuries-old dispute over who was the proper successor to the Prophet Mohammed."}
