{"id": "duc04-testb-45:8#25", "contents": "The indictment accuses bin Laden of leading a vast terrorist conspiracy from 1989 to the present, working in concert with governments, including those of Sudan, Iraq, and Iran, and terrorist groups, to build weapons and attack American military installations. However, the indictment provides few details of bin Laden's alleged involvement in the embassy attacks. It does not specify whether prosecutors have evidence that bin Laden gave direct orders to those who carried out the attacks. The indictment also reveals that bin Laden's group used private relief groups to transmit funds and conducted internal investigations to detect informants, killing those suspected of collaborating with enemies of the organization."}
