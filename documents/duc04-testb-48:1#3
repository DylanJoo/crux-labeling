A statement from the Foreign Ministry claimed Xu was suspected of involvement in activities damaging to national security and had violated relevant criminal codes of the People's Republic of China. The arrest, along with several other activists involved with Xu, sparked strong protests from human rights groups, other Chinese dissidents, and Washington. U.S. officials in Beijing urged the government to release Xu and asked for clarification on the exact nature of his crime."}
