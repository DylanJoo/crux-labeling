{"id": "duc04-testb-48:3#11", "contents": "The crackdown on Corruption Watch is part of a broader effort by authorities to suppress dissent and maintain the Communist Party's ban on opposition groups. In a separate incident, an official in the Sichuan provincial government refused to accept an application by three dissidents to form a branch of the would-be opposition group, the China Democracy Party. Police have detained and questioned many dissidents associated with the group, signaling that the 49-year-old ban on opposition groups remains intact."}
