Despite China's plans to sign the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which guarantees freedoms of speech and assembly, Qin's experiences suggest that local authorities may not observe the treaty. Qin has vowed to continue pushing for human rights, stating that if local authorities don't observe the treaty, \"we will unswervingly push ahead with protecting human rights to the last.\" The treaty's signing is expected to be followed by a visit from British Prime Minister Tony Blair, who has vowed to discuss human rights differences with Chinese leaders."}
