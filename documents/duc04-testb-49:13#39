Speaking to a group of Ukrainian economists, Kuchma emphasized the importance of continuing reforms but did not provide specific details on the proposed changes. He encouraged the economists to submit recommendations prior to a national meeting in November. Ukraine's economic struggles began after the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union, and the recent financial crisis in Russia, its main trading partner, has exacerbated these issues."}
