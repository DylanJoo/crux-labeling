The Greek media and officials have expressed strong opposition to his possible extradition to Turkey, Greece's traditional rival. Ocalan's party has been waging a 14-year war with Turkey for autonomy in southeastern Turkey. The Greek parliament speaker, Apostolos Kaklamanis, stated that Europe has a tradition of civilization and human rights, and it is expected that these principles will be upheld. Greece has not officially responded to Ocalan's arrest, which was welcomed by the United States."}
