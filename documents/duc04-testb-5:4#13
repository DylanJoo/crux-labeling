The group has focused on guerrilla-style warfare in the southeast, as well as carrying out bomb attacks on civilians in western Turkey. Ocalan's detention in Rome may be a turning point for the group, potentially forcing the PKK to transform itself from a rebel army into a political movement. This could be a blessing in disguise, as the group may gain more sympathy and support from Europe and its allies."}
