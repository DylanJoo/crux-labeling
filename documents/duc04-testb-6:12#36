Tony Hall, who recently returned from a trip to remote parts of North Korea, described the food and health situation there as desperate and deteriorating. He shared photographs of North Korean children with severe malnutrition, including patchy hair, protruding bones, and open sores. Hall also brought back a bag of \"substitute food\" distributed by a government food station, which consisted of dried leaves and straw that were ground into powder and made into indigestible noodles. This food has no nutritional value and leaves people with aching stomachs."}
