A new study by international aid groups, the first scientific nutritional survey in North Korea, confirms disturbing reports by international aid workers who have gained increasing access to the population over the past year. The study found that 62 percent of children under 7 years old suffer from stunted growth due to long-term food shortages, indicating that this generation's physical and mental abilities may not develop normally."}
