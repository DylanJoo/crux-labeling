The researchers found that 62 percent of children under 7 had stunted growth, a staggering figure that indicates the severity of the malnutrition crisis. Judith Cheng-Hopkins, regional director for Asia of the World Food Program, described the situation as a \"famine in slow motion,\" where people cope year after year, but the totality of the crisis is difficult to gauge. The study provides hard facts about the crisis, highlighting the urgent need for action to address the malnutrition and hunger affecting North Korea's population."}
