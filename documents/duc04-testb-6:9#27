According to a police official in Tonghua, near the North Korean border, these individuals were not political refugees but rather those who had entered China illegally, formed gangs, or engaged in prostitution. The official emphasized that their return was not a result of disregarding asylum requests, but rather because they had entered China in search of food due to the dire circumstances in North Korea."}
