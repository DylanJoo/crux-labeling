While many Republicans in Congress appear reluctant to engage in a broad fight, they were willing to support the road proposal, which was sponsored by Sens. Ted Stevens and Frank Murkowski, both Republicans from Alaska. The decision has also sparked controversy among environmental advocates, who speculate that Sen. John Chafee of Rhode Island, a leader of Republican environmentalists, changed his position on the road due to the influence of Stevens, who chairs the Appropriations Committee."}
