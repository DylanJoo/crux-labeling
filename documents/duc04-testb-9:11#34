The astronauts had to steer clear of the debris, and Mission Control ordered the pilots to fire the shuttle thrusters to increase the distance between the shuttle and the space junk. Additionally, there were concerns about Endeavour's pursuit and capture of Zarya, as the shuttle's 50-foot robot arm had never before handled an object as massive as the 41-foot, 44,000-pound Zarya. Despite these challenges, the crew successfully completed the docking, marking a major milestone in the construction of the international space station."}
