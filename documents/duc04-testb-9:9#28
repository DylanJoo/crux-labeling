Nancy Currie will use the shuttle's robot arm to hoist Unity from the payload bay and secure it to Endeavour's docking system. The next day, the astronauts will rendezvous with the Russian module Zarya, which was launched into orbit on November 20. Zarya, 41 feet long and weighing 21 tons, will provide power, propulsion, communication, and rendezvous capabilities to the embryonic station. The crew will use the robot arm to pull Zarya into position over Unity, and then Endeavour's commander, Col. Robert Cabana, will nudge the shuttle forward to join the two station pieces together."}
